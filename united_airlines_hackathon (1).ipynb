This is ridiculous, I'm missing important meetings because of this. \\\\n\\\\nAgent: I'm so sorry to hear about the delay, that's definitely frustrating. Umm, let me pull up your reservation and take a look at what happened. *typing sounds* Okay, it looks like there was severe weather in Chicago that caused multiple flight cancellations and delays across the board for all the airlines. Ahh shoot, yeah your original flight was scheduled to depart at 2pm but didn't actually take off until after 5pm.\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: Ugh this is such poor planning on United's part, you should have rerouted passengers or put us on other flights that weren't delayed. Now I've wasted a whole day. \\\\n\\\\nAgent: I understand your frustration sir, delays are never fun. Let me see what options I have available to help make this up to you. Hmm, it looks like I can get you booked on a flight leaving at 3pm tomorrow that will have you landing in New York by 5pm. I'll waive the change fee and provide you with a travel voucher for $200 to help cover expenses from the missed meetings today. Does that work for your schedule?\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: I guess that's better than nothing. But you really need to get your act together, this is unacceptable customer service from United. Your delays are costing people time and money. \\\\n\\\\nAgent: You're right, we want to do better for our customers. I apologize again for the delay and inconvenience. Thank you for flying with us and I hope the rescheduled flight and travel credit help make up for some of the trouble today. Please feel free to reach back out if you have any other issues. Thanks for your patience and for understanding - I appreciate you taking the time to work through this with me.\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: Alright fine. This better not happen again next time I fly United. \\\\n\\\\nAgent: I'll be sure to note your record so we can try and avoid any repeats going forward. Take care and have a good rest of your day.\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: Yeah, you too. *hangs up*\\\\n\\\\nAgent: Thank you for your call, next caller please. *pretends to answer another call* Hi there, thank you for calling United how can I help?\", 1860.0, 420.0, 963118, \"neutral\", \"angry\", -0.04, 0.39, \"Voluntary  Cancel\", \"Matthew Foster\", 4.0], [1122072124, 8186702651, 519057, \"2024-08-01 00:03:00\", \"2024-08-01 00:06:00\", \"2024-08-01 00:18:00\", \"\\\\n\\\\nAgent: Thank you for calling United Airlines, my name is Sam, how can I help you today?\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: Hi Sam, yeah I'm calling because I need to change the dates on my upcoming flight. My flight is booked for next Thursday but something came up and I need to fly out on Monday instead.\\\\n\\\\nAgent: No problem, let me pull up your reservation so I can take a look. Can I get your last name and confirmation number please? \\\\n\\\\nCustomer: Sure, last name is Smith, confirmation number is ASDF456. *makes noise in background* Sorry, the kids are being loud over here. \\\\n\\\\nAgent: No worries, let me see... Okay Mr. Smith, I've got your reservation here for flight UA128 next Thursday. Just giving the availability a check for Monday... Umm it looks like we do have seats available on a flight leaving earlier that day. The fare would be an additional $100 each way though. How does that work for you?\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: Ah man, an extra $100? That's more than I was hoping to pay. Is there any way to get on that flight for the same price as my original ticket? Money is a little tight right now. \\\\n\\\\nAgent: I understand, flight changes usually do incur a fee unfortunately. Let me take a look at some other options... Hmm it looks like the only flight on Monday that wouldn't have a fare increase leaves quite a bit later in the evening. Would a 9pm departure work instead of the original mid-day flight?\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: Ehh that's pretty late. I was trying to get an earlier flight so I have more time once I land. What if I moved my return date back instead of changing the departure? Would that avoid the extra cost?\\\\n\\\\nAgent: Good thinking, let me check return dates... *types silently for a few seconds* Okay, it looks like if you move your return date back by two days there would be no change fee. Your new return flight would then be Saturday instead of Thursday. How does that work for your schedule?\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: Saturday return works great actually, that'll give me more time there too which is nice. Alright, let's go ahead and switch it to depart on the original date but return on Saturday instead. I appreciate you looking into some options to avoid the extra fees.\\\\n\\\\nAgent: No problem, I'm glad we could find a solution that works with your schedule and budget. Okay, I've made those changes to your itinerary. Your new reservation is all set with a Monday departure and Saturday return. Is there anything else I can help with today?\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: No, I think that covers it. Thanks so much for your help, Sam!\\\\n\\\\nAgent: You're very welcome.

My flight is this coming Saturday and I need to change it to a later date.\\\\n\\\\nAgent: No problem, let me pull up your reservation. Can I get your last name and confirmation number please?\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: Sure, last name is Smith, confirmation number is HFG49821. \\\\n\\\\nAgent: Okay, let me take a look here...Smith, HFG49821...yep, I see your reservation for this Saturday. What date did you need to change your flight to? Let me check availability for those dates first.\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: Umm, ahh I was hoping to change it to maybe two or three weeks later, like the first or second week of June. Is there anything available then?\\\\n\\\\nAgent: *typing noises* Let me see...for the first week of June it looks like we only have a few seats left on certain days. How's Tuesday, June 4th? We have economy seats available leaving at 10am and arriving at 1pm.\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: June 4th could work, what would the change fee be for that date? I'm hoping it's not too expensive since it's still over two weeks away.\\\\n\\\\nAgent: Let me take a look at the fare rules for your ticket. *more typing* Okay, since you're changing your flight more than 14 days in advance, the change fee would be $150 plus any difference in fare. The fare for June 4th looks to be about $25 more than your original flight, so the total to change would be around $175. Does that work for you?\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: Hmm, $175 is a bit more than I was wanting to pay. Is there any way you could possibly waive the change fee since I'm a frequent flyer? I fly with United a few times a year for work.\\\\n\\\\nAgent: I understand, change fees can really add up. Let me take a look at your frequent flyer account really quickly...*typing* Okay, it looks like you do have Silver status with us based on the number of flights you took last year. In that case, as a one-time courtesy, I'd be happy to waive the change fee for you. So the total to change your flight to June 4th would just be the $25 difference in fare.\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: Oh wow, thank you so much Steve, I really appreciate you waiving the fee. June 4th will work perfectly then. How can I complete the change?\\\\n\\\\nAgent: You're very welcome, I'm glad I could help save you some money today. To complete the change, I just need to read back your new itinerary details and then I'll send a confirmation email with your new boarding pass. Your new flight will depart Chicago O'Hare on June 4th at 10am and arrive in Denver at 1pm. This will be on the same flight number as your original reservation. Does this all look correct?\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: Yes, that all sounds perfect. Thank you so much for your help, I really appreciate you taking the time to find me an available flight and waiving the fee. You've made this process really easy.\\\\n\\\\nAgent: You're very welcome, it was my pleasure. Thank you for being such a loyal United customer.

Can you provide me with your confirmation number so I can pull up your reservation?\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: Yeah it's PX45T6789. I booked a flight from Chicago to LA for next Wednesday but now I need to change it.\\\\n\\\\nAgent: Okay, let me take a look here... *typing noises* Alright, I see your reservation. What type of change did you need to make?\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: Well the problem is, something came up at work and I need to fly out on Monday instead of Wednesday. But when I try to change it online, it's saying the Monday flight is full and it won't let me switch to it. \\\\n\\\\nAgent: I see. Monday is typically a busier travel day so those seats do fill up quickly. Let me take a look and see if there's any availability I can move you over to. *more typing* Hmm, it looks like the direct flight on Monday is unfortunately booked up. Would you consider an alternate routing with a connection?\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: Ugh really? I was hoping to avoid a layover. *sigh* Alright, what other options you got? This is so frustrating, I just want to get home on time for this meeting.\\\\n\\\\nAgent: I understand the frustration sir. Just give me one moment while I check a few otherflight options for you on Monday... *types rapidly* Okay, it looks like I may have found you a workable option. There's one flight that would get you into LAX Monday evening with only a one hour layover in Denver. Would that routing work for your travel needs?\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: *pause* Yeah I guess that'll have to do. What's the cost to change it to that flight? There better not be some crazy high change fee.\\\\n\\\\nAgent: Let me take a look at the rebooking fee for that itinerary. *more typing* It looks like with the fare differences and change fees assessed, the total to move you to that Monday flight would be an additional $150. I know that's not ideal, but hopefully it's doable given the last minute nature of the change.\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: Ugh $150? That's ridiculous. Isn't there any way you can waive that fee or give me a credit of some kind? This is really putting me out here.\\\\n\\\\nAgent: I understand your frustration sir. Unfortunately with how close to departure your travel date is, our policies don't allow me to waive change fees. However, let me check one other thing for you...*typing* It looks like I may be able to offer you a $75 travel voucher that could be used on your next United booking to offset the fee. Would that work for you?\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: *long sigh* Yeah I guess that'll have to do. Alright, go ahead and change it to that Monday flight then. And send over the details for the voucher too.\\\\n\\\\nAgent: No problem, I have you switched over to that Monday itinerary with the one hour layover in Denver now. The additional $150 charge plus $75 travel voucher have been applied to your reservation. Is there anything else I can help with today?\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: No, I think that's it.

What would you like to know about your flight?\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: Well, umm I booked the flight a few months ago but I've had some changes in my schedule come up. Is there any way I can change the date of my flight to a few days later? \\\\n\\\\nAgent: Let me take a look at your reservation and see what options we have for changing the date. *typing can be heard* What's the name the reservation is under?\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: John Smith. The original flight was scheduled to leave O'Hare on March 15th.\\\\n\\\\nAgent: Okay, I've pulled up your reservation Mr. Smith. It looks like we do have some seats available on flights leaving a few days later. Would the 17th or 18th work better for your new travel plans?\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: Hmm let me think, the 17th might work better. What would the costs be to change it to that date? I'm hoping it wouldn't be too expensive since I'm only changing it by a couple days.\\\\n\\\\nAgent: Let me check the fare difference for changing it to the 17th. *more typing* It looks like there is a $100 change fee that would apply since you're within the refund/change window. But the fare itself hasn't increased too much, it's only a $50 difference from what you originally paid. So the total to change it would be $150. Does that work for your budget?\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: Ah man, $150 is a bit more than I was hoping to pay. Any chance you could waive any of those fees since I'm a loyal united customer? I fly with you guys a few times a year.\\\\n\\\\nAgent: I understand the change fees can be frustrating. Let me take a look at your account history really quickly to see if there's anything I can do. *typing for a bit* It looks like you do fly with us regularly and always check a bag, so you've built up some frequent flyer miles. I'm happy to waive the $100 change fee since you're a loyal customer. The fare difference of $50 would still apply but at least that saves you $100. Does that work?\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: Yeah, that would work! Thank you so much for being willing to help out, I really appreciate it. You just saved me a good chunk of money.\\\\n\\\\nAgent: You're very welcome, I'm glad I could help! I'll go ahead and process that change for you now to the March 17th flight.

Umm, so I recently found out I'll be unable to travel due to a work thing coming up. I was hoping there was a way I could change or cancel my flight.\\\\n\\\\nAgent: No problem, let me pull up your reservation. *typing noises* Okay, I've got your flight here from O'Hare to Heathrow next Monday. Unfortunately that flight is non-refundable so your options for changing it would either be to switch to another travel date within the next year for a $150 change fee, or you could apply the value of your ticket as a travel credit that's good for future travel within the next 12 months. How does that sound?\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: *sighs* Yeah that's kinda what I was afraid of. Travel credits aren't super helpful for me since I don't know when I'll be able to go to London next. Would there be any way to maybe get a partial refund or anything instead? Money's a bit tight with this work thing coming up.\\\\n\\\\nAgent: I understand the frustration, travel changes are never ideal. Let me take a look here at any other options...hmm it doesn't look like we have any refund availability on this specific fare class. I could check with my colleagues in our refunds department to see if there's any leeway but I wouldn't want to promise anything. Would you like me to put in a request to see if a partial refund is possible? There may be a fee for processing it but it couldn't hurt to ask.\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: Ugh yeah, I guess it wouldn't hurt to ask them. This is kind of annoying...I know it's not your fault and all but these big airlines really gouge you on fees, you know? Makes it tough when unexpected life stuff comes up. But yeah, please go ahead and put in that refund request if you don't mind, and let me know what they say. I appreciate you taking a look!\\\\n\\\\nAgent: No problem, I completely understand the frustration. Airline policies can definitely be rigid. Let me go ahead and submit that refund request for you now. It may take a day or two for a response. In the meantime, just to reiterate your options - you're welcome to change flights for a $150 fee or accept a travel credit. But I'll cross my fingers that refunds comes back with something more helpful. Can I get your email so I can follow up once I hear back?\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: Yeah, fingers crossed! My email is jsmith@email.com. And if refunds can't do anything, I guess I'll probably just go with the travel credit for now since I don't want to lose the full value. Thanks so much for your help Aaron, I really appreciate you taking the time to look into this.\\\\n\\\\nAgent: You're very welcome, I'm happy I could help explore some options for you. I'll be sure to reach out to that email address within the next couple days once I have an answer from refunds. And don't hesitate to call back if you have any other questions.

All the morning and midday flights are fully booked. I could look at flying out the day before if you're able to change your travel dates. Would an overnight in LA before your original travel plans work? Or is there no flexibility there?\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: Are you kidding me? An overnight? That wasn't in the budget. This is ridiculous, you guys canceled my flight, the least you could do is get me on something earlier that day. What am I supposed to do for half a day in the airport? \\\\n\\\\nAgent: I apologize for the inconvenience. Let me check a few other things...*typing for a bit* It looks like we may have an option to get you there earlier after all. If you're open to flying into Burbank airport instead of LAX, there is a 10am flight with open seats. I could transfer your reservation to that routing at no additional cost. The Burbank airport is only about 20 minutes north of LAX so you'd still get in around midday. Would that work better for your travel plans?\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: *long sigh* I guess Burbank would have to do then. At least it's something. It's just so frustrating that I even have to change anything, this all your airlines fault for canceling my original flight. \\\\n\\\\nAgent: You're right to be annoyed about the change, it's certainly not ideal. I'm going to go ahead and transfer your reservation now to the 10am flight into Burbank. Please let me know once you receive the confirmation email and you've had a chance to review the new itinerary details. As an apology for the inconvenience, I'm also going to credit your account with a $75 travel voucher that can be used on a future United purchase. Thank you for your patience and for flying with us. Hopefully the earlier flight into Burbank will help make the rest of your trip go smoother.\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: Thanks I guess. Not like the voucher really makes up for this headache but whatever.

I could switch your ticket over to that flight instead at the same fare, if that works a little better for you?\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: Ugh, a red-eye, are you serious? That's even worse. This is such bullshit. Why can't you guys ever get your shit together? I pay good money for these tickets and now you're going to make me be all jet lagged and exhausted at work on Monday. This is unacceptable.  \\\\n\\\\nAgent: I understand your frustration, sir. Dealing with travel changes is never ideal. Perhaps I could look into getting you rebooked on an alternative itinerary, like flying into a different California airport on Sunday or Monday instead? That might open up some additional flight options. It may take a little longer drive but could avoid the overnight flight. Let me pull up a few other routes and see what's available. *extended pause as agent searches other flight options* Okay, it looks like we have a few seats left on a flight departing O'Hare Sunday afternoon arriving in San Diego around 7pm. I could switch your ticket to land there instead, and then you'd have the full Monday in California before needing to travel further for work. Does that potentially work better for your schedule?\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: Ugghh, finally something that's not completely terrible I guess. Alright fine, switch me to that San Diego flight then. But you guys really dropped the ball on this one. I expect some sort of compensation for all this trouble. \\\\n\\\\nAgent: I understand, and I sincerely apologize again for the inconvenience. As a courtesy for having to change your plans at the last minute, I'd be happy to provide you with a $100 travel voucher to put towards future bookings with us. Does that sound fair to help make up for the disruption?\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: *long sigh* Yeah I guess $100 will have to do. Just don't let this happen again okay? You guys really lost a customer today. \\\\n\\\\nAgent: You have my word we'll work harder to avoid situations like this going forward. Thank you for your patience and for continuing to fly with us.

I'm just a little nervous about missing my connection in London. This is an important business trip and I really need to make that meeting on Friday. \\\\n\\\\nAgent: No I completely understand the importance. Missing an international connection can really throw a wrench in your plans. Let me see here...the flight from Chicago lands in London at 6:15am on Friday and your connecting flight to wherever you're heading next is at 10am. Even allowing some time for customs and getting to the next gate, that should still be plenty of time as long as the first flight isn't too delayed. But I'll make sure to note the tight connection in your file as well, so if there are any issues they'll know to get you rebooked promptly. How does that sound?\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: Yeah, that makes me feel a lot better. As long as you guys will rebook me right away if there are any major delays, I think I'll be okay. These storms can be pretty unpredictable though, so I just want to have a backup plan.\\\\n\\\\nAgent: Absolutely, that's a smart way to approach it. Let me go ahead and get you on a standby list for the same flight the next day just in case. That way if anything causes more than a 2 or 3 hour delay and it looks like you might miss that connection, we've already got an alternate routing in place for you. Just be sure to keep an eye on your phone and email in case we need to confirm getting you switched over. Other than that, is there anything else I can help with today?\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: No, I think you covered everything. I feel a lot better about my trip now. Thanks so much for taking the time to help me plan for potential issues, Steve. I really appreciate United having great customer service agents like you to help sort things out.\\\\n\\\\nAgent: You're very welcome, I'm always happy I could help put your mind at ease. Safe travels and I hope you have a smooth flight and productive business meeting. Thanks for flying United, you have a great rest of your day!\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: You too, thanks again! *hangs up*\\\\n\\\\nAgent: *hangs up*\\\\n\\\\nSo in summary - the call duration was around 12 minutes and 30 seconds which fits within the given call duration time of 797 seconds. I tried to make the conversation flow naturally between the agent and customer with pauses and filler words. The customer's question and concerns centered around the potential for flight delays due to weather. And the agent was able to rebook the customer on an alternate flight and set them up with alerts, making for a reasonably positive sentiment score of 0.06.

How may I help you today?\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: Hi, I'm calling to complain about my recent flight from Chicago to New York. The flight was delayed for over 3 hours with no explanation given. We were just left sitting on the plane! This is unacceptable. \\\\n\\\\nAgent: I understand your frustration with the long delay, sir. Umm, let me pull up the flight details. What was the date of your flight? \\\\n\\\\nCustomer: It was last Wednesday, the 15th. Flight number UA108. \\\\n\\\\nAgent: Okay, let me see... *typing noises* According to our records, that flight experienced significant weather delays in Chicago which caused a system-wide ripple effect across our network. I apologize for the lack of communication during the long wait on the plane. In situations like this where delays are within our control, passengers deserve more timely updates. \\\\n\\\\nCustomer: I don't really care about the reason for the delay - things happen. But three hours is ridiculous! And then being left in the dark the whole time just made it that much worse. You're darn right you should have communicated with us. \\\\n\\\\nAgent: You're absolutely right, sir. Ah, we failed to meet our customer service standards in this situation. Is there anything I can do to assist in making this up to you? I'd be happy to provide a refund for the cost of the ticket or offer you future travel credits if you plan to fly with us again.\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: Honestly, I'm not sure I want to fly United again after this experience. But I guess a travel credit would be better than nothing in case I don't have another option one day. How does 200 dollars sound?\\\\n\\\\nAgent: I'll be honest, I don't have the authority to offer a credit that large on my own. Let me check with my supervisor and see if we can offer $175, would that work for you? Just a moment please while I call them... *pretends to be on hold* Okay, they've approved $175, does that seem reasonable given the delay and lack of communication you experienced? \\\\n\\\\nCustomer: You know what, fine. $175 credit it is. But you guys really need to get your act together on customer service. People pay good money for these tickets and then you leave them hanging for hours - it's not okay. \\\\n\\\\nAgent: You're completely right, and I sincerely apologize again on behalf of United. Customer experience is a top priority for us, and incidents like this undermine the trust passengers place in us. Thank you for taking the time to share your feedback - it will be reported to the relevant teams to ensure we can improve. Is there anything else I can help with today?\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: No, I think that about covers it. Just don't let it happen again! \\\\n\\\\nAgent: You have my word we'll work hard to avoid similar situations going forward. Thank you for flying United, despite the delay, and enjoy the rest of your day.\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: Alright, goodbye. \\\\n\\\\nAgent: Thank you for your call.

Umm, is there any way I can change the flight to a later date? \\\\n\\\\nAgent: Sure, let me pull up your reservation. What's the flight number and date you have booked currently?\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: It's flight UA1245 next Thursday, August 15th. \\\\n\\\\nAgent: Okay, let me take a look... *typing sounds* Hmm it looks like that flight is pretty full for next week. Let me check availability for the following week. *more typing* It looks like we have seats available on the same flight, UA1245, for Thursday August 22nd. Would that work better for your schedule?\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: *sighs* Ah man, I was hoping for something even later than that. Work has been so busy and crazy lately, I really don't think I can take the time off until like the last week of the month. There's just no way around it, you know? Is there any flights available then?\\\\n\\\\nAgent: I understand, things come up all the time with work schedules. *checks availability for end of month flights* Let me see...it looks like the last week of the month, the only flight we have around the same timeframe as your original one leaves on Thursday, August 29th at 3pm. Would that work for your schedule? I'm afraid most of the other flights are booked solid.\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: Yeah, I mean that date works but the time is actually even worse for me. Ugh, this is so frustrating. Is there really no other option at all? I really need to move this trip.\\\\n\\\\nAgent: Sorry to hear this is causing you frustration. Let me take a few more minutes to look at other airline options and see if we have any flexibility. *types some more* Hmm, it doesn't look like we have any earlier seats available on our end. May I suggest checking some other carriers to see if they have availability on flights you prefer? I'd be happy to look up times for you on a different airline if you don't mind flying with someone else. Sometimes other companies have seats when we're full.\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: Ugh, I really don't want to fly with anyone else, I'm loyalty status with you guys. Isn't there anything at all you can do on your end? I've been a customer for years.\\\\n\\\\nAgent: I completely understand your frustration, as a loyal customer I'm sure flying with another airline is not ideal. Let me check just a couple more things... *puts call on hold and checks with supervisor* I'm so sorry for the inconvenience, but it really seems like that late August 29th flight is the only United option. However, as an appreciated customer, let me go ahead and waive the change fee for you on that flight move. Does that help at all? I know it's not an earlier date, but it may make the change a bit easier.\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: Ugh, fine I guess I don't have any other choice then. Alright, you can switch me to that August 29th flight then. But I better get an upgrade on it since you guys aren't being very flexible! \\\\n\\\\nAgent: I completely understand your frustration. Let me go ahead and process that flight change for you. The good news is we do have some upgrade seats available on that route, so I'm happy to get you confirmed in a upgraded cabin at no additional cost due to this inconvenience. Just give me one moment to make all the changes...okay all set! You're all changed over to the August 29th flight in our United first class. Thank you so much for your patience and for being a loyal customer. Please let me know if there's anything else I can do for you today.\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: Fine, thanks I guess. This still isn't ideal but I don't have any other choice. Alright, well have a good one then.  \\\\n\\\\nAgent: You're very welcome, and thank you for understanding. I do apologize again we couldn't get you on a better date. Please feel free to reach back out if any other issues come up before your trip.

What seems to be the issue with your flight? *typing sounds* Okay, I've got your booking here for flight UA108 next Wednesday. What can I do for you?\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: Well the thing is, ahh I just found out I need to be in San Francisco a day earlier than planned. Do you have any seats available on an earlier flight that week? *background noise of people talking* \\\\n\\\\nAgent: I see. Let me check flight availability for the days before your scheduled travel date. *more typing* It looks like we have some open seats on flight UA105 that departs Chicago on Tuesday. Would changing your flight to that day work for your schedule?\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: Umm yeah Tuesday would be perfect actually. How much would it cost me to change my flight to that earlier date? I'm hoping it wouldn't be too expensive since it's only a one day change.\\\\n\\\\nAgent: Let me take a look at the fare difference here. *typing* Okay, so because this is considered ainerary changes within 7 days of travel, there would be a $150 charge per ticket to switch you over to the Tuesday flight. Does that fee work for your budget?\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: Hmm $150 does seem a bit steep just for one day. Is there any way you could possibly waive that change fee since it's such a minor change? I'm a very loyal United customer and fly with you guys all the time for work. \\\\n\\\\nAgent: I understand, changing plans last minute can be frustrating. Let me check if there's any leeway I have on waiving the fee. *puts customer on brief hold while checking* Thanks for your patience. I was able to get approval from my supervisor to waive the change fee just this one time, as a courtesy for your frequent flying with us.

What seems to be the issue with your flight?\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: Well when I logged into the app to check my booking, the flight doesn't show up anymore. I got an email a few days ago saying there was a schedule change but it didn't give me any new details. \\\\n\\\\nAgent: I see, thanks for providing those details. Let me take a look at your reservation here... *typing noises* alright, it looks like your flight was rescheduled due to a maintenance issue with the aircraft. The new departure time is 2 hours later, leaving at 11am instead of 9am. Does that flight time still work for your travel plans?\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: Not really no, that really messes things up for me. Is there any way I can get on an earlier flight or get a full refund since you guys changed the schedule?\\\\n\\\\nAgent: I understand the change is inconvenient. Let me see what options I have for you. *more typing* Unfortunately the only flights leaving before 11am are fully booked. As for a refund, since this was a schedule change made by the airline and not a cancellation, the best I can offer is a travel credit for the full amount to be used on a future United flight within the next year. Would that work for you?\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: Ugh, a credit isn't really helpful for me right now. I was supposed to be in LA for a wedding on Wednesday evening. Is there really no earlier flight I can take or another airline I could fly instead? \\\\n\\\\nAgent: You're right, I apologize the credit doesn't help with your current travel needs.

I can reimburse you the difference in fare.\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: Yeah, go ahead and book me on that American flight.

Can you tell me what happened with your flight?\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: Yeah so first of all your website was nonsense and I couldn't figure out how to check in online. Then when I got to the airport, your check-in line was like a mile long. I was standing there for over an hour just to drop my bag. \\\\n\\\\nAgent: Okay, I understand the check-in process can be frustrating when it takes a long time.

No one was telling us what was going on.\\\\n\\\\nAgent: Umm, I'm really sorry to hear about that long delay at the gate. Delays are never fun but communication is key. Was the flight still delayed when you eventually boarded?\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: Yes! We finally board and then sit on the tarmac for another hour. The pilot comes on saying some nonsense about paperwork but who knows if that was even true. By the time we took off I had missed my connection and my whole weekend was ruined. This is unacceptable service. \\\\n\\\\nAgent: Ah man, that is extremely frustrating to have a delay like that cause you to miss your connection. *pause* Let me take a look here at exactly what happened with your flight. What were the dates and flight numbers?\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: It was last Saturday, February 12th. My original flight was United flight 1542 from Chicago to Denver. Then I was supposed to connect to flight 1927 to Billings but obviously I missed that one. Now I demand to be compensated for this horrible experience. \\\\n\\\\nAgent: Okay, just looking up the notes here on flight 1542. *typing noises* It looks like there was a maintenance issue that caused the departure delay. The pilot was waiting on some paperwork to be cleared before taking off. I'm really sorry about the missed connection, that's never ideal. Umm, let me see what I can do as far as compensation. Would you accept a $500 voucher for future travel?\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: $500? Are you kidding me? I want a full refund of my tickets plus extra for how much this messed up my whole weekend. I spent hundreds on a hotel and activities that I couldn't do because of your delays. I expect United to make this right.\\\\n\\\\nAgent: You're right, I apologize the $500 doesn't fully make up for the disruption. Let me consult my supervisor here and see if we can offer more. *holds phone* Just spoke to my manager and we'd like to offer you a full refund of the tickets which were... how much were the original tickets?\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: The tickets were $650 roundtrip. But like I said, I want compensation for the other expenses too. This is poor customer service and you need to make it right. \\\\n\\\\nAgent: You make a fair point, sir. We certainly want to take responsibility here for the delays causing you to miss your connection. Okay, how about this - we'll refund the full $650 for the tickets and give you an additional $750 voucher that can be used for future travel or expenses. Does that sound like it would make up for the trouble?\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: *long sigh* I guess that will have to do. But I better be able to use that voucher anytime, none of this blackout date crap. And don't think I won't be telling everyone I know how bad your service is. \\\\n\\\\nAgent: You have my word the voucher can be used anytime, no blackout dates. And thank you for the feedback - we're always trying to improve the customer experience. I appreciate you taking the time to go over this experience with me. Is there anything else I can help with today?\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: No, I think you've wasted enough of my time already. Just process those refunds and vouchers.

And I was hoping to return on Sunday instead of Monday if possible.\\\\n\\\\nAgent: Got it, let me check availability for those dates. *typing* Okay, it looks like we have seats available on those flights you're looking to switch to. I'll go ahead and process the date change for you. The good news is there won't be any change fees since you're changing the dates more than a week before departure.

What's the name the flight is booked under?\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: It's under John Smith. The reservation number is 45GTR9. \\\\n\\\\nAgent: Okay, let me take a look here...*typing noises* Yep, I've got your flight booked for next Thursday leaving at 10am.

That Thursday just isn't going to work for me anymore.\\\\n\\\\nAgent: Let me check availability for that Monday...*more typing* Unfortunately it looks like all the flights that day are fully booked. The next available flight I see is Tuesday afternoon, leaving at 3pm. Would you like me to switch you over to that flight instead? There would be a $75 change fee applied.\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: Ah man, Tuesday won't work either. *sighs* What other options do I have then? Would I be able to get a refund if I cancel?\\\\n\\\\nAgent: I understand the date change is inconvenient. Let me pull up your fare rules to check on refund options. *takes a minute to review details* Unfortunately since it's within 7 days of your travel date, the ticket is non-refundable. I may have another option for you though - would you consider flying out on Saturday instead? We have seats available on a morning flight leaving at 8am.\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: Hmm Saturday...that could work actually. What would the cost be to switch to that flight?\\\\n\\\\nAgent: Let me go ahead and process that change for you. The $75 fee would still apply but other than that the fare would remain the same. So your new total would be the original ticket price plus $75. Does that work for you?\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: Yeah, I think I can swing that. Alright, let's go ahead and switch me over to the Saturday flight then please.\\\\n\\\\nAgent: Okay, I've just finished updating your reservation. You're all set on flight 45GTR9 now leaving this Saturday at 8am. You'll receive an email confirmation shortly.

I know you usually charge a fee for changes. \\\\n\\\\nAgent: Yes, there is a $150 fee per ticket to make changes to your itinerary this close to your travel date. However, since this is a schedule change and not a cancellation, we can waive the fee just this once as a courtesy. To change you over to that Thursday morning flight, it wouldn't be any additional cost. Does that work for you?\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: Ah okay, yeah that sounds good then.

This is such bullshit. I booked this flight months ago specifically for the date I need and now I have to change my whole schedule?

The next flight out is at 9:15am and I can add you to the standby list for that one.\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: I guess that's my only option, huh?

Please let me know if you have any other questions in the meantime.\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: Okay, thanks I guess. This still really sucks but $100 helps a little.

Do you have any other airline I could fly instead? I need to be there today and that two hour flight isn't going to cut it. \\\\n\\\\nAgent: You're right, that two hour flight wouldn't get you there in time.

Does that work or would you like me to look into other options like flying out tomorrow?\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: Are you kidding me?! A connecting flight that gets me in at midnight? That's ridiculous. This is the third delay on this flight already, you'd think they'd have their act together by now. I need to be in Denver first thing tomorrow, there's no way I'm going to be functional after a late night travel day. I want to be compensated for this massive inconvenience. What can you do for me?  \\\\n\\\\nAgent: You're right, having multiple delays on your flight is unacceptable. Let me see what I can do for you by way of compensation. *typing* For the disruption to your travels, I'm able to get you a $400 travel voucher that's valid for one year. I'll also go ahead and change your flight to tomorrow at no additional cost. Does a noon departure time work better for your meeting schedule?

And I have patients I need to see tomorrow morning so I can't leave until at least 2pm.

How can I help to remedy this situation?\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: Hi Jennifer, I've been on the phone for over an hour dealing with this airline nightmare. My flight has been delayed three times, meaning I'm going to miss a big client meeting tomorrow that I've had on the books for months. On top of it all, the best they can do is a midnight flight or a noon flight that's still too early. I need to fly out at 2pm at the earliest. This is unacceptable customer service. I want a full refund of my tickets plus $1000 for my troubles. Your constant delays have cost me a lot more than $400 in lost time and missed opportunities.\\\\n\\\\nSupervisor: Sir, I understand your frustration completely. Delays of this nature are never acceptable. Let me see what I can do for you... *more typing* Okay, due to the multiple lengthy delays and the disruption to your travel plans and business, I'm authorizing a full refund of the cost of your tickets. On top of that, I'm crediting $1000 to your United frequent flyer account that can be used for future travel or upgrades. Additionally, I've rebooked you on our 2pm flight to Denver tomorrow at no charge. Will this work for your schedule? Please accept my sincerest apologies for the poor experience you've had with us.\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: Alright, I suppose that will have to do. Thanks Jennifer. Please pass along my frustration to the folks in maintenance - clearly they need to get their act together. Have a good evening.\\\\n\\\\nSupervisor: You're very welcome sir, and thank you for your patience. I will definitely share the feedback with the right teams.

I just wanted to double check because I saw something about potential weather delays online. Should I be concerned about any delays or cancellations with this flight?\\\\n\\\\nAgent: Let me check the forecast for next week. *more typing* It looks like there is a chance of some rain and wind in Chicago on Tuesday but nothing too severe that would cause major delays or cancellations. United does do a good job of adjusting schedules if needed to minimize impacts to customers. Of course, things could possibly change between now and then but based on the current forecast I wouldn't be too concerned. Does that help put your mind at ease a bit?\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: Yeah, that's reassuring to hear. As long as it's not being cancelled or anything major. I'm just a bit of a worrier when it comes to travel, you know? Umm, just one other question, when would be the latest I could get an alert about any changes? I'm traveling for work so I'd need to make arrangements if it got delayed or cancelled.\\\\n\\\\nAgent: No problem, I completely understand the worry. Let me check our rebooking policies for your flight. *more typing* For domestic to international flights, we generally provide advance notice of any cancellations or delays of 3 hours or more at least 72 hours prior to the scheduled departure time. Of course, we'll always try to notify customers as soon as possible if any changes do happen. If there are any updates to the schedule between now and your flight, you'll also receive an email and can check the flight status on our website or mobile app. How's that? Does 72 hours work for making alternate arrangements if needed?\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: Yeah, 72 hours should be enough time to make other plans if I had to. I appreciate you taking the time to look into this and help put my mind at ease. It really helps calm my nerves to get information directly from the source. \\\\n\\\\nAgent: You're very welcome, I'm glad I could provide some reassurance. Traveling for work can definitely add some extra stress. Please don't hesitate to call back if you have any other questions between now and your flight.

What's the confirmation number?\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: It's B4382R9. *sound of papers rustling* Sorry give me one second, it's written down here somewhere...ah found it!\\\\n\\\\nAgent: Okay, let me take a look here...yep I see the flight was canceled due to weather. No problem, let me see what other flights we have available to get you out to LA. *typing sounds* It looks like we have a few options for tomorrow afternoon or evening if that works for you. How does a 4pm flight look?\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: Hmm the 4pm flight could work but I was hoping for something earlier in the day if possible. You see I have an important meeting in LA first thing Monday morning so the later the flight the less time I'll have to prepare. \\\\n\\\\nAgent: I understand, no problem. Let me see what else is out there...it looks like we do have one seat left on an 8:30am flight tomorrow. Would that work better for your schedule?\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: Yeah the 8:30am flight would be perfect! What would I need to do to book that one?\\\\n\\\\nAgent: Great, I'm happy we could find an option that works better for your schedule. To book the 8:30am flight, I'll just need to transfer you over to the same reservation. It looks like you paid for your original ticket with a credit card so I can go ahead and use that same card to pay for the change. The difference in fare should be about $75 more than what you originally paid. Does that work for you?\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: Yeah, that's fine - go ahead and switch me over to the 8:30am flight. I just want to make sure I'm all set to fly out in the morning. This meeting is really important so I don't want any issues. \\\\n\\\\nAgent: No problem, I completely understand the importance.

I was wondering what my options are for changing or cancelling the flight.\\\\n\\\\nAgent: Okay I understand, let me pull up your booking. *typing noises* Yep, I've got the flight here leaving O'Hare next Wednesday. In terms of changing or cancelling, since it's within 7 days of travel the ticket would be non-refundable. However, we can rebook you onto another flight within the next year without paying any change fees. *pause* Would you like me to look into some alternative travel dates for you?\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: Umm, yeah that would be great if you don't mind. I'm just not sure yet how I'm gonna be feeling in a few days you know? Probably best to have a back-up plan just in case. *sniffle* \\\\n\\\\nAgent: No problem, let me see what I can come up with for you. Hmm, it looks like we have space on a flight leaving this Saturday if that works better for you timing-wise? Otherwise there's also flights on the following Monday or Tuesday that week if Saturday is too soon. We could rebook you on any of those options free of charge. *sound of typing* Just let me know which works best and I'll get the change processed.\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: Saturday could work actually, what time does that flight leave? And would I be able to get the same seating I have now?\\\\n\\\\nAgent: Let me check on the flight details and seating for Saturday. The departure is at 3:15pm from O'Hare, arriving in London at 6:15am the next morning. Ah it looks like the only middle seats left are in economy, but we can get you an aisle seat if that works?

I really appreciate you helping me switch it over, it'll be nice to have that backup just in case. How do I go about cancelling the first flight if I end up taking the Saturday one?\\\\n\\\\nAgent: You're very welcome, I'm happy I could help find an alternative that works better for your situation. If you do decide to fly out on Saturday, just let me know and I can cancel the original flight for next Wednesday at that time. There's no need for you to take any action on your end to cancel. *pause* Is there anything else I can help with before I process this change?\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: I think that's everything for now, thanks so much David I really appreciate you taking the time to help me out. Hopefully I'll be feeling better by Saturday but it's nice to have that backup flight booked.\\\\n\\\\nAgent: You're very welcome, it was my pleasure.

Let me take a look at our availability for that route on Wednesday. *typing noises* Umm, it looks like we have seats available on a flight leaving at 10am and arriving in New York at 12:30pm. How does that work with your schedule?\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: Hmm, that 10am flight might work actually. Can you tell me what the change fee would be to switch to that one?\\\\n\\\\nAgent: Let me check your ticket details...it looks like your current ticket is non-refundable so the change fee would be $150 plus any difference in fare. The fare for the 10am flight is actually $25 cheaper than what you originally booked so after the $150 change fee your total would be $125. Does that work for you?\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: Ah man, $150 is pretty steep. Any way you could waive the fee since I'm changing it for the same airline? It's not like I'm cancelling.\\\\n\\\\nAgent: I understand the frustration with change fees. Let me take a look at your account details and see if there's anything I can do...it looks like you've been a loyal United customer flying with us a few times a year. As a one-time courtesy I'll go ahead and waive the change fee for you this time. Does switching to that 10am flight on Wednesday work?\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: Wow, thank you so much Sam I really appreciate you doing that. Yes, please switch me over to that 10am flight. You just saved me $150!\\\\n\\\\nAgent: You're very welcome, I'm happy I could help out. I've gone ahead and processed the change for you. You'll receive an email confirmation shortly.

Is there any way to change my flight to that day?\\\\n\\\\nAgent: Let me check availability for Wednesday. *more typing* It looks like we do have seats available on the Wednesday flight leaving at 11:15am. I'll need to collect a $75 change fee to switch you over to that flight. Does changing to Wednesday at 11:15am work for your travel plans?\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: Hmm, $75 change fee is a bit more than I was hoping for. Any chance you could waive that or is there any flexibility there? Money is a little tight with everything going on lately. \\\\n\\\\nAgent: I understand, change fees can definitely add up. Let me take a look here...*typing* Unfortunately with it being so close to your original travel date, our system won't allow me to waive the fee in this case. How set are you on needing to fly out Wednesday? I might have another option for you.\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: Umm, Wednesday would be preferable but I'm open to other options if it saves me that fee. What else ya got?\\\\n\\\\nAgent: No problem, let me check a couple other possibilities. It looks like there is space available to fly out Tuesday evening instead at 5:30pm, and I could switch you over to that flight at no additional cost since it's more than 2 days before your original travel date. Would flying out Tuesday evening work with your schedule?\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: Tuesday evening could work, yeah. What's the arrival time into New York with that flight?\\\\n\\\\nAgent: The Tuesday flight would land in New York at 8:15pm. Does flying out Tuesday evening and arriving around 8:15pm work for your travel plans? If so, I can go ahead and process the change for you at no extra cost.\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: You know what, Tuesday evening flight works great. Yeah, go ahead and switch me over to that one please. I really appreciate you finding an option that doesn't charge me a change fee.\\\\n\\\\nAgent: No problem at all, I'm happy I could help find a solution. Just one moment while I process this change for you...*typing noises*...okay, you're all set Mr. Smith. You'll now be flying out on Tuesday at 5:30pm and arriving in New York at 8:15pm.

You can also pay more to upgrade to a higher boarding group or select seating if any are still available on the flight.\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: Okay, thanks.

What change were you looking to make?\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: Well the problem is I just found out I have a work thing I need to be at on Thursday, so I need to change my return flight to get back on Tuesday instead of the original Wednesday. Is there any way to do that?\\\\n\\\\nAgent: Let me take a look at our flight options for Tuesday. *typing noises* Umm, it looks like the only flight we have that would get you back on Tuesday leaves around midnight on Monday. How does that work with your schedule?\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: Leaving on Monday night? That's gonna be awful, I'll be exhausted. And it was supposed to be a short trip anyway. Is there any chance of getting on an earlier flight maybe on a different airline? This is such short notice I didn't know what options there might be.\\\\n\\\\nAgent: I understand the Monday night flight isn't ideal. Let me see what other airlines have available...it looks like American has a flight leaving London around 3pm on Tuesday that would get you into Chicago in the early evening. Would that work timing-wise? It's on a different airline though so I'd need to process this as a cancellation and rebook on American to ensure you get the right protections.\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: Tuesday at 3pm would be perfect actually. Yeah go ahead and cancel the United flight and book me on that American one instead. How much is that going to cost me? This is so frustrating, I can't believe I have to change it now.\\\\n\\\\nAgent: I completely understand your frustration, last minute changes are never fun. Let me take a look at the cancellation and rebooking fees here...okay, so because this change is within 14 days of departure it is considered a significant change so there will be a fee of $200 to process the cancellation. Then the fare for the American flight is $650. So the total for the changes would be $850. Does that work for you?\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: $850?! Are you kidding me? That's outrageous. I already paid almost $1000 for the original United flight. This is ridiculous, I shouldn't be penalized this much for one little change. There has to be something you can do, this is insane. \\\\n\\\\nAgent: I apologize for the high fees, I know last minute changes can be really expensive. Let me see if there's any way I can help lower the costs a bit. Umm...it looks like since you booked with us a month ago, as a one-time courtesy I can waive the $200 cancellation fee. But I'm afraid I can't do anything about the price of the new ticket on American since that's set by them. Would $650 for the new flight work better for you than $850? I wish there was more I could do...\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: *sighs loudly* I mean it's better than $850 but still, this is a lot of money. This really sucks. I don't know, let me think about it for a minute. *long pause* You know what, fine. Go ahead and book it. I really don't have any other options at this point. But I'm not happy about it.\\\\n\\\\nAgent: I completely understand. These last minute changes are never easy on anyone. For what it's worth, I'm sorry you're in this situation. If there was any other way I could help lower the cost I would, but my hands are tied by the airline policies. Please let me know if there's anything else I can do for you in the future. And I do hope your trip next week goes smoothly despite the change. Will you be paying with the same credit card you used before?\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: Yeah same card. 4562 8921 2345 6788. Just go ahead and charge it so I can be on my way, I have a lot to do to get ready for this trip now. Oh and by the way, you can be sure I won't be flying United ever again after this headache.\\\\n\\\\nAgent: I have your payment processing now.

Let me go ahead and get you set up in a hotel near the airport for tonight so at least you're comfortable while waiting for your rescheduled flight. I'll also be adding a $500 credit to your United account for the inconvenience. Does that help resolve the issue?\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: I guess it'll have to do.

Let me see what availability looks like for that date. *more typing* Hmm, it looks like the only seats left on that flight are in economy plus, which would be an upgrade from the regular economy you originally booked. The good news is, it won't cost you any change fees to swap dates. But you would have to pay the difference in fare, which in this case is an additional $150. Does that work for you?\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: You know, that's actually not too bad. I was afraid it would be more expensive than that. Alright, go ahead and switch it over to the 15th then. At least that way I can spend a bit more time in London.\\\\n\\\\nAgent: Great, I'm happy we could find an option that works for your schedule. Just one moment while I process this change for you...okay, all set! You're now booked on the United flight from Chicago to London, returning on August 15th in the economy plus seating. Is there anything else I can help with today?\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: No, I think that covers it. Thanks so much for your help Diana, I really appreciate you being able to change that date for me.\\\\n\\\\nAgent: You're very welcome, John. Happy travels and enjoy your extra time in London! Thanks for calling United Airlines, you have a wonderful rest of your day.\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: You too, bye!\\\\n\\\\nAgent: Bye! *call disconnects*\\\\n\\\\nHow was that?

How may I help you today?\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: Hi, yeah I'm calling because I'm really not happy about my recent flight. The flight was delayed for over 3 hours with no explanation and then when we finally took off, I barely had any legroom. It was the worst travel experience I've ever had.\\\\n\\\\nAgent: I'm really sorry to hear about the problems with your flight, sir. May I please have your confirmation number so I can pull up your record? There seems to be some static, let me try moving to another line. *pretends to switch phone lines* Okay, that's a bit better. What was your confirmation number again?\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: *sighs loudly* It's B3F4J2. I want to complain about the horrible service and see if there is any compensation I can get. This was completely unacceptable. \\\\n\\\\nAgent: Okay, let me take a look here...*typing noises* Yup, I see the flight from Chicago to Denver on the 12th. I'm terribly sorry about the long delay and cramped seating. Delays like that are never acceptable without communication. Umm, let me see what options we can provide to make up for your poor experience. According to our records, the delay was due to maintenance issues with the aircraft. We definitely should have kept passengers updated on the situation. *pause* It looks like we can offer you a $300 travel voucher for your next United flight since this was so unplanned and inconvenient for you. Would that work for your needs?\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: Are you kidding me? $300? That hardly even covers the cost of one ticket. I want a full refund and not just some measly voucher. You guys really dropped the ball here. \\\\n\\\\nAgent: You're right sir, $300 is certainly not sufficient compensation for the multiple issues you experienced. Let me see if there is anything else I can do for you. Hmm, I'm afraid our policy does not allow for a full refund this long after the flight. However, I could issue a voucher for $500 instead to partially reimburse you for your troubles. I'll also be sure to note your record that you had serious dissatisfaction with this flight so you receive priority boarding on future flights. Does that package sound any better to you? I'm happy to try to negotiate further if needed.\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: *sighs again* I guess $500 is better than nothing. But I better be getting first class upgrades for life after this. Your airline really needs to get it together. \\\\n\\\\nAgent: I understand your frustration completely, sir. Unfortunately I don't have the authority to offer lifetime first class upgrades, but I will make a note of your request in the special instructions section of your file. The best I can do is provide you with Gold status in our frequent flyer program, which will qualify you for upgrades to first class when available. You'll also receive priority boarding, two checked bags free on every flight, and a 25% bonus on all miles flown. Please let me know if granting you Gold status will satisfy you for this experience. I really appreciate your patience in working through this with me.\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: Alright, fine. Gold status is acceptable I guess. Just don't let this happen to me again.\\\\n\\\\nAgent: You have my word we'll do everything possible to ensure you receive excellent service moving forward. Thank you for flying with us and for your time today. I hope the upgraded benefits and voucher help recoup some of the negative experience from this flight.

Confirmation number is HX47392.\\\\n\\\\nAgent: Okay, just give me one second to pull that up... *typing noises* Alright, I've got your reservation here Mr. Smith. Your flight from New York to Chicago is scheduled for next Thursday at 11am.

Really hoping I can make this flight on time.\\\\n\\\\nAgent: I understand the frustration, it's been a challenging time for travel. Let me take a look at the flight status for next week to give you an update. *more typing* It looks like the forecast for that day is clear skies so no weather concerns. United has been operating on schedule for that route as well. While nothing is guaranteed, based on current conditions it seems you should have no issue making that flight. But I'd be happy to discuss some backup options just in case.\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: That's reassuring to hear, I'm feeling a bit better about it now. What kind of backup options do you have available just in case there are any delays?\\\\n\\\\nAgent: Okay, let me pull up alternatives for you. If for some reason that original flight gets delayed or cancelled, we have a few other options that day. We have another nonstop around 1pm that would get you into Chicago only a couple hours later. There's also a connector flight that would get you there in the evening if needed. I can also take a look further out in case you need to arrive in Chicago on a different date. Does looking at some backup flights help ease your mind a little?\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: Yeah, having those backup options makes me feel more comfortable about the trip. I really appreciate you taking the time to look into this for me Sarah. You've been very helpful.\\\\n\\\\nAgent: You're very welcome, I'm glad I could provide some reassurance. Don't hesitate to call back if you have any other questions before your flight. And please let me know if any changes come up with that original schedule.

The forecast is saying there could be snow and I need to get to LA for a work thing, so is there any way to change my flight to an earlier date? \\\\n\\\\nAgent: Okay no problem, let me take a look at your booking details. What's the name the reservation is under? *typing noises* Yep, I've got your flight here for next Tuesday. Unfortunately all the flights on Monday are fully booked so the only option I can see to get you there earlier would be to fly out on Sunday. How does that sound? I can move you over to the Sunday flight but it will be an extra $150 change fee since it's within the 7 day window.\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: Ugh $150? That's ridiculous, the weather wasn't even a forecast when I booked this originally. There's gotta be something you can do, I really need to get there on time. This work thing is super important for my job. \\\\n\\\\nAgent: I understand the frustration with the weather and needing to ensure you get there on time. Let me check a few other options for you...*typing noises* Unfortunately all the flights on Monday are still showing as full. However, since this is due to potential weather issues rather than a schedule change on our end, I may be able to waive the change fee for you just this once as a goodwill gesture. Does moving you to the Sunday flight work with your schedule? I'll just need to get your confirmation on agreeing to that new flight time before I can make the change.\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: Ugh, Sunday isn't really ideal either since I was supposed to work Monday morning.

Unfortunately, since it's within 7 days of travel there will be a $100 change fee plus any difference in fare. The 5am flight is $50 more than what you originally paid. So the total to change would be $150. Does that work for you?\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: Hmm, $150 is a bit more than I was hoping to pay. Any chance you could waive any of those fees given it's just a small timing change?\\\\n\\\\nAgent: I understand, flight changes can definitely add up cost-wise.

That's outrageous. This is all your fault for canceling my original flight. *makes angry noises* I'm your million miler, you should be accommodating me. Ugh, I guess the 3pm flight will have to do but you need to waive that fee. It's the least you could do for your best customers.  \\\\n\\\\nAgent: I'm sorry for any confusion, but we didn't cancel your original flight. According to our records, it's still scheduled to depart tomorrow as planned. As for the change fee, as a million miler you do receive certain benefits from us due to your travel frequency. However, our change fee policies do still apply across all fares. The most I can do is reduce the fee to $100 given your loyal status. Does that work for you to switch to the 3pm flight next Saturday?\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: Are you even listening to me?! I said I can't make that first flight. And $100 is still too much. I want it waived completely or I'm just going to cancel and fly with a different airline. You'll lose a million miler. How's that for your bottom line?\\\\n\\\\nAgent: I understand your frustration, but unfortunately I cannot waive the change fee entirely in this case. However, as a show of good faith to a valued customer such as yourself, I'm willing to reduce the fee by an additional $50. So the total to change your flight to next Saturday would be $50. Beyond that, I'm afraid it's the best I can do while still following company policies. Please let me know if I can switch your reservation to the new date with that compromise change fee of $50.\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: Ugh, fine I guess $50 is better than $150. Go ahead and change it. But don't think I'm going to forget about this poor experience. I'll be sure to tell all my friends to avoid United. This is ridiculous customer service.

I'm assuming there will be some type of change fee right?\\\\n\\\\nAgent: You're right, since this would be considered a flight change rather than a cancellation, there would be a fee involved. Let me take a look at the fare rules for your ticket. *typing noise* Alright, it looks like the change fee for your booking is going to be $150 plus any difference in fare. The good news is the fare is the same for that earlier flight, so it would just be the $150 change fee. Does that work for you?\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: Hmm, $150 is more than I was hoping to pay. Any chance I can get that waived or reduced at all since this is sort of an special circumstance with the new job? \\\\n\\\\nAgent: I understand the frustration with the change fee. Given the situation with your new job, let me see if there's anything I can do. One second here...*typing for a bit* Okay, after reviewing your record and the reason for the change, I'm going to go ahead and waive that $150 fee just this once. I'll make the change to the earlier flight at no additional cost. Does that work for you?\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: Wow, thank you so much Sarah I really appreciate you working with me on this. Yeah going ahead and switching me over to that 9am flight works perfect. You just saved my butt!\\\\n\\\\nAgent: You're very welcome, I'm happy I could help get you switched to a flight that will work better with your new job. Safe travels and congratulations on the new position! If you need anything else, please don't hesitate to call back.

Would that work for your schedule? There would be a change fee of $150 since this is within the 7 day cancellation window.\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: Ah man, $150 is a lot. Is there any way to waive the fee since it's last minute plans changing? \\\\n\\\\nAgent: I understand last minute changes can be tricky. Let me take a look at your account history really quickly...I see you've been a loyal customer flying with us a few times a year. I'll go ahead and credit your account back the $150 change fee just this once as a goodwill gesture.

Is there any way I can change it to a week earlier? The reason is something came up with work and I need to travel earlier than planned.\\\\n\\\\nAgent: Sure, let me pull up your reservation and take a look to see what options are available for changing your date. *typing sounds* Okay, I've got your booking here. What was the original travel date?\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: It was scheduled for May 15th. \\\\n\\\\nAgent: Got it. Let me check our seat availability for a week earlier on May 8th. *more typing sounds* Unfortunately it looks like that flight is completely full for the earlier date. However, I'm showing we do have seats available if you would be willing to fly out on May 10th instead, how does that work for your schedule?\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: Hmm that's still not quite early enough. Is there any way to get on the May 8th flight maybe if someone cancels? I'd be willing to wait if a seat opens up. \\\\n\\\\nAgent: I understand the need to travel earlier. Let me go ahead and put you on our waitlist for the May 8th flight just in case a seat does become available due to a cancellation. I'll also send you an email update within 24 hours letting you know if anything opens up. In the meantime, would you like me to book you on the May 10th flight as a backup option?

What would you like to know about your flight?\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: Well, umm...let me pull up my reservation here *sounds of typing in background* okay, so I'm flying from Chicago to London next Thursday. But I noticed the departure time on my ticket changed from the original time I booked. It's now an hour earlier. \\\\n\\\\nAgent: I see, thanks for providing those details. One moment while I take a look at your reservation...*typing noises* okay, it looks like there was a schedule change made to that flight. Unfortunately flight times are subject to change until departure. Did the new departure time work for your travel plans?\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: Ah no, not really. The original time I booked worked a lot better with my plans in London. Is there any way I can switch back to the original time or maybe another flight that day? I'm really hoping not to have to change my whole itinerary. \\\\n\\\\nAgent: I understand the schedule change is inconvenient. Let me see what options we have for you. *more typing* It looks like the flight you originally booked is now fully booked. However, there is one seat left on a slightly later departure, would a 1:30pm departure time work instead of the 11am you were originally on? I can switch your reservation to that one at no additional cost since the schedule change caused the issue.\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: Hmm, 1:30pm could potentially work but it's cutting it close with the plans I have in London that evening. Would there be any other flights later that same day I could switch to instead? I'd hate to take that one and risk it not working out. \\\\n\\\\nAgent: You're right, better safe than sorry if the 1:30 flight is tight. Let me check other flight options that day...okay, it looks like the last flight out is at 3:45pm and it has multiple seats still available. Would you like me to switch your reservation to that flight instead? The good news is since this is considered a significant schedule change due to more than a 2 hour difference, you'd be entitled to a refund as well if this flight doesn't end up working out for you after all.\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: You know what, I think I'll feel better booked on the 3:45 flight just to give myself a bigger buffer. And I'd definitely appreciate the refund option too, that's great to have just in case. Alright, go ahead and switch me over to that flight then please.\\\\n\\\\nAgent: No problem, I'm happy we could find an option that works better for your travel plans. Just give me one moment to process the change...okay, it's all set! You're now booked on the 3:45pm United flight from Chicago to London on the original travel date.

I'm afraid I can't reimburse your hotel and meals directly but hope this will go some way to apologizing for your experience. \\\\n\\\\nCustomer: *sighs* Fine, I suppose that will have to do.

Will that help make up for the poor experience?\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: A $100 voucher? Are you kidding me? This whole ordeal ruined my work trip and you think $100 will make up for it? I want a full refund, and not just for my flight - I want my entire trip refunded. Flights, hotel, meals, everything. This is unacceptable service.\\\\n\\\\nAgent: Ma'am I understand your frustration, but unfortunately I am unable to provide a full refund for your entire trip.

Midway? That's like an hour outside the city for me. And what am I supposed to do, just miss the meeting on Tuesday that I had already planned around? This is ridiculous. \\\\n\\\\nAgent: I understand your frustration sir, changing travel plans last minute is never ideal. Let me see if there are any other options. *more typing* Unfortunately all the flights on Monday from either airport are booked. However, I could put you on our standby list for Monday's flight from O'Hare, and if any seats open up we would be able to switch you over at no charge. I know it's not ideal, but it's the best I can offer given the limited availability. Does that maybe work or would you like me to try rebooking you for a later date?\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: Ugh, I don't know. Standby isn't very reliable, right? There's no guarantee I'd get on that flight. I have to be in Denver on Monday, this is such a pain. \\\\n\\\\nAgent: You're absolutely right, standby isn't a guarantee. Let me check one other thing for you...*typing* It looks like we do have availability to get you to Denver on Monday, but it would require taking one of our affiliate airlines instead of United. The flight would be leaving Midway around 5pm and connecting through St. Louis. I know it's a bit of a longer trip but it would get you there on the day you need. Would you be open to that option instead? I can get you booked on that flight right away.\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: Ah man, a connection through St. Louis? That's going to add like 3 hours to the trip. And flying out of Midway is just such a hassle. I don't know, this is all really frustrating. It feels like you guys aren't even trying to help me out here. \\\\n\\\\nAgent: I completely understand your frustration sir. These last minute changes are never easy. Let me take a step back and see if there's anything else I can explore. Hmm...would moving your return flight back by a day instead of changing the departure work? That might open up more options to get you to Denver on Monday as planned. And I apologize, you're right that standby and multiple connections aren't very convenient solutions. Just give me a few more minutes to look into this further. In the meantime, is there anything else I can help with? Something to drink perhaps while you wait?\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: No, I'm good, thanks. And yeah, pushing my return back a day could maybe work, as long as I'm not having to pay any change fees or something ridiculous. This is already going to be a huge hassle on my end to rearrange things. \\\\n\\\\nAgent: I totally understand. Let me check if moving your return date back a day would waive change fees. *more typing sounds* Okay, good news - since this is a schedule change being proposed by United, I'd be able to waive the change fee for adjusting your return flight. And it does look like that opens up a few more options on the Monday departure. If you're open to it, I believe I can get you booked on the 11:15am flight to Denver out of O'Hare tomorrow. How does that sound?\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: You know, at this point that actually does work for me. As long as I'm not paying any fees to change it, then yeah go ahead and switch me to that flight tomorrow.

Is there any way I can change my flight to depart on Monday instead of Tuesday?\\\\n\\\\nAgent: Let me check availability for Monday. *pause as agent reviews flight options* It looks like we do have seats available on a flight leaving on Monday at 11am. I'll need to collect a change fee of $150 since it's within 7 days of travel. Does that work for you?\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: Ugh, $150 just to change the day? That's pretty steep. Do you think there's any way you could waive the fee since it's only a one day change? \\\\n\\\\nAgent: I understand the fee seems high for such a small change. Unfortunately since it's within the week of travel our change policies are non-refundable. Let me take a quick look and see if there are any notes on your reservation...hmm it doesn't look like there would be any waivers available in this case. I'm sorry I can't offer better news on the fee.\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: Ah man, that really puts me in a tough spot. I guess I don't really have another option but to pay it, huh? You sure there's no discounts or anything you could apply?\\\\n\\\\nAgent: I apologize for not having better options. If money is really tight, one thing you could try is calling our reservations number back after your original flight departs on Tuesday. Sometimes cancelled seats become available at lower rates. It's a bit of a gamble not knowing for sure, but it could save you that change fee. Other than that, the $150 is the lowest fee I have available to switch you to Monday.\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: Damn. Alright, I guess go ahead and switch me then. *sigh* You take credit cards right? Let me give you my info.\\\\n\\\\nAgent: Yes we accept all major credit cards. Go ahead and read me the number and expiration. *typing noises* Okay sir, I've processed the change fee and your flight is now scheduled to depart on Monday at 11am. You'll receive an email confirmation shortly. Please let me know if you need anything else.\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: Sounds good, thanks for your help John.

The original flight I booked is next Saturday but something has come up and I need to fly out this Friday instead.

Your original flight is next Saturday from Chicago to Los Angeles, correct?\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: Yes, that's right. \\\\n\\\\nAgent: Okay, let me check availability for this Friday. *typing noises* Hmm, it looks like the direct flight on Friday is fully booked. However, there is still availability if you're open to a connecting flight. That would have you flying from Chicago to Denver, then having a 2 hour layover before continuing on to LA. Would that work for your schedule?\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: Umm, I'd really prefer to avoid the connection if possible. Are there any other options?\\\\n\\\\nAgent: Let me see...the only other flight I see leaving Chicago on Friday goes a little out of the way, but it would get you to LA only about an hour later than the direct flight. It would have you flying to San Francisco first, then continuing on. Would you be willing to do that route instead?\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: Ah yeah, an extra hour is fine. What would the cost be to change my flight to that one?\\\\n\\\\nAgent: Okay, great. Let me take a look at the fare difference...it looks like the fare for that new flight is about $100 more than what you originally paid. I'll go ahead and process the change to your reservation now. The good news is since this is within the airline's change fee deadline, there won't be any additional fees besides just paying the difference in fare. Does that work for you?\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: Yeah, that works. As long as it's not too much more, I can do that route. Go ahead and process the change for me then.\\\\n\\\\nAgent: No problem, just give me one moment...okay, I've successfully changed your flight.

It was a complete disaster.\\\\n\\\\nAgent: I'm sorry to hear about your poor experience. Can you tell me what happened on your flight?\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: Well first of all, your gate agents were a mess. They kept changing the boarding time and it seemed like they had no idea what was going on. Then when we finally boarded, we sat on the tarmac for over an hour with no updates. People were getting annoyed. \\\\n\\\\nAgent: Umm, yeah that's definitely not ideal. Delays on the tarmac are never fun. *typing noise* Let me pull up the flight details. What's the date of your travel?\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: It was last Wednesday, April 6th. Flight 237. \\\\n\\\\nAgent: Okay, got it. *more typing* According to our records, that flight did experience a lengthy delay due to maintenance issues. The agents probably should have communicated better with passengers during that time. I can understand your frustration with the lack of information.\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: The problems didn't end there. Once we took off, the cabin was uncomfortably hot. I saw a flight attendant tell the pilot but he never did anything about it. We were all sweating and miserable. \\\\n\\\\nAgent: Hmm, that's not good. Temperature control on planes is important for customer comfort. *typing* It looks like the air conditioning pack for that aircraft was malfunctioning that day. I'm really sorry you had to endure that on top of the delay. Was there anything else that made the experience poor?\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: When we landed, it took forever just to get off the plane. The crew was unorganized with disembarking. Then to top it all off, my bag was lost! I had to wait at the carousel for over an hour before I gave up. This was hands down the worst flight I've ever been on. You need to do something to make it up to me.\\\\n\\\\nAgent: Ah man, I can understand why you're so frustrated. It seems like every aspect of that trip encountered some kind of issue. Having your bag delayed on top of everything else is just pouring salt in the wound. *pause as agent thinks of a solution* Okay, let me see what I can do for you here.

Is there anything else?

That screws up my whole week. This is ridiculous customer service, I expect to be able to change my flight without all these issues. Why can't you just rebook me for free like a normal airline?\\\\n\\\\nAgent: I understand your frustration sir, dealing with travel changes is never ideal. Unfortunately our change policies within 14 days are there to protect the fare you agreed to when booking. While I wish there was more flexibility, my hands are tied by the rules. Perhaps we could look into getting credit for a future flight instead of a rebook fee? That way you aren't out additional costs but still have options later once plans are more settled.

What would you like to know about that flight?\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: Well, ahh I was hoping I could change the departure time. The flight I'm currently booked on leaves too early in the morning and I was hoping there was a later flight I could switch to. \\\\n\\\\nAgent: Sure, let me pull up your reservation and take a look at the schedule for that day. *typing noise* Okay, I've got your booking here. The flight you're currently on leaves at 6am, right?\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: Yeah that's the one. It's just a little too early for me since I'll be flying in from out of town the night before. \\\\n\\\\nAgent: No I completely understand, early morning flights can be tough. Especially after traveling. Let me see if there's anything later that day...*more typing* It looks like we have another nonstop flight leaving at 9:30am.

Is there any chance I could switch to that flight instead?\\\\n\\\\nAgent: Let me take a look at seat availability on that flight...*typing* It looks like there should be plenty of seats open still. I can absolutely switch you over to that 9:30am flight. I'll just need to collect a $75 change fee from you since it's within a week of your travel date. Does that work for you?\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: Yeah, $75 is fine. Umm, how can I pay that? Over the phone?\\\\n\\\\nAgent: Absolutely, I can take your payment information over the phone right now if you're ready. I'll just need your name, billing address, and credit card number.

May I have your confirmation number so I can take a look at what happened?\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: *rattles off confirmation number angrily* Just tell me what you're going to do about it. This delay caused me to miss an important business meeting today.  \\\\n\\\\nAgent: Let me pull up your reservation...okay, it looks like there was severe weather in Chicago last night that caused multiple flight cancellations and delays. I apologize for the inconvenience. *types quietly for a few moments* It looks like we have you booked on a flight out tomorrow morning, but let me see what other options there might be to get you there sooner. Umm...it doesn't look like we have any non-stop flights available today but I may be able to route you through Denver or Dallas if you're willing to make a connection. How does that sound?\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: Are you kidding me? A connection? That'll take forever. And I can't change my meeting, it's important. You need to find me a direct flight today or compensate me for this mistake.

There's a big storm coming. \\\\n\\\\nAgent: I understand your concern about the weather. What's the flight number and what time is your departure? Let me take a look at the forecast and see if there are any alerts on your flight. *types* Okay, according to the forecast your flight is still on schedule to depart at 4:05pm. Of course storms can change quickly so I'd recommend checking your flight status on the United app or online within a few hours of your departure time just to be safe. \\\\n\\\\nCustomer: But what if it does get cancelled? I really need to get to LA for a work thing tomorrow. Is there any way you can get me on an earlier flight today just in case? \\\\n\\\\nAgent: Hmm, let me see what earlier options we have...*more typing* Unfortunately the next few flights to LA are all booked up solid. We're showing a lot of crews and aircraft out of position due to all the weather delays and cancellations recently. I could try to get you on a later flight tomorrow if your original one doesn't go, but getting you out today may be tricky without a standby ticket. Do you have United MileagePlus elite status by any chance?\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: Ugh, no I don't have status. This is so frustrating. I told my work I'd be there tomorrow and now it seems like it might not happen. Can you at least get me on a flight with another airline?\\\\n\\\\nAgent: I understand your frustration, weather delays are never fun. Let me check around and see if any of our partner airlines have seats available on earlier flights. *typing intensifies* It looks like American has a 5:30pm flight from Chicago to LA with a few first class seats left. I can book you on that and cover any change fees if your United flight ends up departing as scheduled. How does that sound?\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: Yeah, I guess that'll have to work. At least it's earlier than my United flight. Thanks for trying. This whole thing just has me stressed, you know? I hope the weather cooperates.\\\\n\\\\nAgent: I completely understand, it's never a fun situation to have your travel plans up in the air due to mother nature. But hopefully this American flight will give you a bit more flexibility if needed. Just be sure to check your flight status throughout the day tomorrow on the apps. And if any issues come up with that American flight, give us a call back and we'll do our best to reroute you. You should be receiving an email shortly confirming the new itinerary. Please let me know if you have any other questions!\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: Okay, thank you. I appreciate you helping me change things over to the earlier flight. Fingers crossed it all works out.

Umm, let me take a look at your original itinerary and see what options we have for getting you to LA today. *typing noises* Okay, it looks like the delay was due to severe thunderstorms in Chicago last night.

Delays are never ideal but safety has to come first during severe weather.

I need to be compensated more than that. This is unacceptable customer service from your airline. \\\\n\\\\nAgent: You're right, sir, losing out on a day's work is significant. Let me check what additional compensation I'm able to offer. *typing noises* I'm afraid $200 is the maximum voucher amount I'm able to provide according to our customer service policy for delays outside of our control. However, I can credit your account with 15,000 bonus miles as a further goodwill gesture. Will that work for you in addition to rebooking you on the overnight flight?

This has been a huge waste of my time though, and your airline needs to do better. \\\\n\\\\nAgent: I completely understand your frustration. Thank you for your patience and for allowing me to assist you further. I've gone ahead and booked you on the overnight flight, which will get you into LA around 7am tomorrow morning.

How much more would it be to switch to that flight?\\\\n\\\\nAgent: Just give me a second to redo the fare calculation...okay, since this is a fare difference it would be an additional $150 to switch your flight to the day earlier. Does that work for your budget?\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: *sighs* yeah I guess so, this change came up pretty last minute. Alright, go ahead and switch me over to that flight then please.\\\\n\\\\nAgent: No problem, let me get that changed for you. *typing noises* Okay, I've got you switched over to the overnight flight leaving Chicago the day before. You'll depart at 9pm and arrive in LA at 6am. Do you need a boarding pass emailed to you or do you have the app to download it?\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: Yeah, can you just email it to me please? My email is [email protected] \\\\n\\\\nAgent: You got it, I'm sending that over to you now. Is there anything else I can help you with today?\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: I think that's it for now, thanks so much for your help Sarah, I really appreciate you getting me on that earlier flight.\\\\n\\\\nAgent: You're very welcome, I'm happy I could help accommodate the change.

How may I help you today?\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: Hi Steve, yeah I'm calling about a flight I have booked from Chicago to London next Monday. I wanted to ask about changing it.\\\\n\\\\nAgent: Okay, no problem. Let me pull up your booking details. Can I get your last name please? \\\\n\\\\nCustomer: Sure, it's under the name Johnson.\\\\n\\\\nAgent: Got it, let me take a look here...okay Mr. Johnson, I see you have flight 8172 booked to leave O'Hare at 1:45pm next Monday. What change were you looking to make to that booking?\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: Umm, ahh.. yeah so a change came up with work and I now need to leave a day earlier. Is there any way I can change my flight to this Sunday instead? I'd really appreciate it.\\\\n\\\\nAgent: I understand, last minute changes with work can be tricky. Let me check availability for this Sunday. *types briefly* Hmm, it looks like the only flight I have available leaving Chicago for London on Sunday is at 10:30am. Would that work with your schedule or is the time too early?\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: Ugh, 10:30am might be a little tough. What would it take to change it to that flight? And is there any chance of getting an earlier flight on Monday instead maybe?\\\\n\\\\nAgent: Okay, let me check both options for you. To change your flight to this Sunday at 10:30am, it would be a $150 change fee since it's within 7 days of departure. For moving it earlier on Monday, the next flight I see leaves at 11:15am. That one would just be a $25 fee since it's a smaller change within the same day. Does the 11:15am Monday flight work better for you?\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: Hmm, yeah I think sticking with Monday but getting on that 11:15 flight would be preferable to the super early Sunday departure. Alright, let's do that then please. *sighs* $25 isn't too bad I guess. This work stuff has really been throwing me for a loop, you know?\\\\n\\\\nAgent: No problem, I understand the frustration. Just one moment while I process the change for you...okay, you're all set on flight 8174 now leaving at 11:15am on Monday. The $25 fee has been added to the reservation. Is there anything else I can help with today?\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: No, I think that covers it. Thanks so much for your help, Steve. I really appreciate you being able to change that for me. It will make the work week a lot less stressful.\\\\n\\\\nAgent: You're very welcome, happy to help. I'm sorry about the last minute change but glad we could get you on an earlier flight on Monday. Safe travels and I hope the work stuff smooths out for you soon. Please don't hesitate to call us directly if any other issues come up.

I wanted to check if there were any changes to the schedule.\\\\n\\\\nAgent: Sure, no problem. Let me pull up your reservation. May I have your last name and confirmation number please?\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: Yeah, it's under Johnson, confirmation number is 45RT8964. \\\\n\\\\nAgent: Okay, let me take a look here... *typing noises* Johnson, 45RT8964... alright, I've got your reservation here. Your flight from New York to Chicago is still scheduled to depart at 10am on Tuesday. Is there any particular reason you're asking about changes to the schedule?\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: Well, ahh last time I flew with United there was a delay and I almost missed my connecting flight. I have an important meeting that day in Chicago and wanted to make sure there won't be any issues. \\\\n\\\\nAgent: I understand the concern, delays and cancellations can definitely cause problems. Let me take a look at the flight history between those two cities. *more typing* It looks like over the last 6 months, this flight has typically departed within 15 minutes of the scheduled time. Only a handful of delays over 30 minutes. United has been working hard to improve on-time performance. Of course, things like weather can still cause delays but based on recent history, everything looks good for your flight next week. Does that help put your mind at ease?\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: Yeah, it does make me feel a bit better. The weather has been crazy lately so I just wanted to double check. As long as there's no major delays I should be fine to make that meeting. Umm, is there any chance of getting an earlier flight just in case? I'd feel more comfortable with a buffer.\\\\n\\\\nAgent: I understand the desire to have a buffer, especially with important meetings. Let me see what other flight options there are that day... *typing again* It looks like the only earlier flight is at 8am but it's showing as full currently. I can try putting you on the stand-by list for that flight in case any seats open up before your travel date. There is no guarantee but it would give you a better chance of getting on that earlier flight. Would you like me to go ahead and do that?\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: Yeah, that sounds good. At least I'd have a shot then. I really appreciate you checking into this for me Steve, it makes me feel a lot better about the trip.\\\\n\\\\nAgent: You're very welcome, I'm glad I could help alleviate some of the stress. I've got you listed as stand-by on the 8am flight now. Be sure to check your email 48 hours before departure for any updates. And don't hesitate to call back if you have any other questions before your trip. Safe travels to Chicago!\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: Thank you so much, you too. Have a good one!\\\\n\\\\nAgent: You as well, take care! *pretends to hang up phone* Okay, let me just document this call...\\\\n\\\\nHow was that? I tried to make the conversation sound as natural as possible between the customer and agent. I filled it with pauses, slang words and speech fillers to mimic an actual phone call.

Umm let me pull up my confirmation, one second...okay yeah flight number 1235 from Chicago to LA last Thursday. \\\\n\\\\nAgent: No problem, let me take a look at that flight for you. *typing sounds* Okay, it looks like that flight arrived into LAX about an hour late. What seems to be the issue you're having with it?\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: Well the main problem is that it was so delayed! Like over an hour, that's ridiculous. I missed my connection to Sydney because of it and had to spend the night in LA. United didn't put me in a hotel or anything, I had to pay out of pocket. Then on top of that, my bag didn't make it either so I've been without clothes and toiletries this whole trip. It's been a huge hassle. \\\\n\\\\nAgent: I understand your frustration with the delay and missing connections, that's never a good experience for passengers. Let me take a look at what options we may have to help make this right. *more typing* It does look like the flight from Chicago encountered severe weather that caused the lengthy delay. As for your missed connection, unfortunately our flight schedules do not allow for sufficient connecting time for delays over an hour. In situations like this we should have put you in an overnight hotel and delivered your bag, I apologize that did not happen. Let me see what I can offer you by way of compensation.\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: Ugh yeah the weather excuse is getting old, feels like that's always the reason lately. And thanks but honestly at this point compensation isn't really what I'm after, I just want to get home now. Is there any way I can get on an earlier flight back to Sydney or maybe get a full refund so I can book another airline? This has completely ruined my trip.\\\\n\\\\nAgent: I understand your frustration, missed connections are never fun. Let me check on getting you rebooked...it looks like we do have space on a flight to Sydney tonight that leaves LAX at 9pm, would that work for you to get you home sooner? I'll go ahead and get you switched over to that flight at no additional charge. As for your original ticket, unfortunately we cannot provide refunds for weather delays that are outside of our control. But I'll be happy to compensate you $600 for the missed connection and baggage inconvenience - does that seem fair? Will that help resolve the issue for you today?\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: Ah man a 9pm flight still means hanging around the airport all day with nothing. And $600 really doesn't feel like enough to make up for losing a whole vacation day and having to pay for a hotel. Is there any wiggle room on the refund if I can find my own way home tonight? \\\\n\\\\nAgent: You're right, hanging around the airport all day isn't ideal after all the delays. Let me see if there's anything else I can do...It looks like we have non-refundable airline credits that are valid for up to a year, would $1,000 credit towards future United travel work instead of the $600 refund? And unfortunately our policies don't allow for refunds on non-refundable tickets when delays are due to weather or things outside our control. But I can offer you an additional $300 credit on your United card to help cover expenses. Does that combined $1,300 total help resolve things so you can salvage the rest of your trip? I know it doesn't make up for lost time but hopefully it shows our commitment to taking care of loyal customers.\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: *long sigh* you know, I think I'm just gonna cut my losses on this one. The credit does help but I'm so frustrated that I don't think I'll be flying United again anytime soon. But I appreciate you working with me on this.\\\\n\\\\nAgent: I completely understand your frustration and don't blame you for feeling that way at all. Thank you for your patience and for working with me to try and resolve things - I'm sorry we couldn't fully make up for the experience you had. Please do consider using the credits for future travel once you've had time to cool off. And feel free to reach back out if there's anything else at all I can assist with.

Is there any way I can move it to a week later? The same flight just a week later?\\\\n\\\\nAgent: Let me take a look at availability for that routing a week later... *more typing* Hmm, it looks like that flight is pretty booked up for next week as well. What was the reason you needed to change the date? I can take a look at our options for getting you rescheduled.\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: Ugh, yeah work stuff unfortunately came up so I can't make the original date. Would there be any way to maybe switch to a different flight instead of the same one? Or is it too late to make any changes?\\\\n\\\\nAgent: I understand, work stuff can definitely come up unexpectedly. Let me check some alternative flight options for you instead of trying to move the same one... *typing again* It doesn't look like we have any seats left on flights that same day, but I do see there is still availability two days later leaving at 4pm, would that work for your schedule? As long as we change it before the original flights departure in 5 days there shouldn't be a change fee.\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: Hmm yeah two days later could work, what would the cost be to switch to that flight instead? I'm hoping it wouldn't be too much more since it is still over a week away.\\\\n\\\\nAgent: Let me take a look at the fare difference between the flights... *typing some more* Okay, so the original flight you booked was $349, and the 4pm flight two days later would be $379. So only a $30 difference to switch over to that one. And like I said, as long as we process the change before your original departure, there won't be any additional fees on top of that $30 fare difference. Does that work for your schedule and budget?\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: Yeah you know what, I think I can swing that $30. Alright, go ahead and switch me over to that 4pm flight in two days then. Thank you so much for checking on options for me, I really appreciate you taking the time.\\\\n\\\\nAgent: You're very welcome, I'm happy I could find an option that works with only a small additional cost.

Your original flight was delayed due to severe weather in Chicago. Unfortunately all the flights to LA tonight are booked up.

Let me check some other airline options for tonight... *more typing* it looks like there is one seat left on a 9pm Southwest flight that gets into LAX at midnight. I can switch your booking over to that flight but you'll have to pay the difference in fare. The upgrade would be an additional $250.\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: $250?! Absolutely not, that's outrageous. This delay is going to cost me thousands in missed deal opportunities. United needs to step up and do better than this. There has to be something else you can do for me.\\\\n\\\\nAgent: I apologize for the added costs sir, I can understand how inconvenient and expensive the changes are. Let me check one more time if any earlier flights on other airlines have opened up...umm, it doesn't look promisin\\u2014*dog barking in background* sorry about that. Unfortunately the 9pm Southwest flight is really the only option departing tonight. I could waived the change fee but the fare difference would still apply. Would you like me to go ahead and rebook you on that? Otherwise the 6am United flight is no cost to you.\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: This is such garbage. I've been a United customer for years and this is how you treat your loyal flyers? Put me on hold for a minute, I need to make a decision here. *holds line* \\\\n\\\\nAgent: Of course, take your time. *light music plays for 2 minutes* I'm still here whenever you're ready sir.\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: Alright look, I'm just going to tough it out and take the morning flight. But United owes me big time for this massive hassle. I expect a $500 voucher emailed to me by end of day tomorrow for all the troubles. And you're picking up the tab for my hotel tonight.\\\\n\\\\nAgent: I understand your frustration and really appreciate your loyalty to United. Unfortunately I don't have the ability to issue vouchers over $500. The best I can offer is a $300 travel credit that can be used for future United flights. As for your hotel, I'm afraid I can't cover personal expenses. But I've added a 500 mile bonus to your frequent flyer account to thank you for your patience. How does that sound? \\\\n\\\\nCustomer: Ugh, this is such a joke. $300 isn't going to come close to making up for all of this. But I don't have time to argue further. Just send over the travel credit already so I can book a damn hotel. Don't expect me to fly United again any time soon.\\\\n\\\\nAgent: I'm sorry we couldn't do more to improve your situation.

How may I help you?\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: Hi, yeah I'm calling because my flight from Chicago to Tokyo tomorrow was cancelled. I really need to get to Tokyo for a business meeting. What can you do to help me get there?\\\\n\\\\nAgent: I'm sorry to hear your flight was cancelled, that's definitely frustrating. Umm, let me pull up your reservation and take a look at your options. *typing noises* Okay, it looks like the weather in Chicago is really bad tomorrow so all flights are being impacted. Give me just a second to see what other flights we have leaving in the next day or two...ahh it looks like we have space available on a flight leaving tonight at 8pm, would that work for your schedule? It's a nonstop flight that would get into Tokyo around noon their time. \\\\n\\\\nCustomer: Tonight? Ugh that's really last minute. Is there any way I could get on a flight tomorrow even if it has a layover? This meeting is really important and I don't want to be exhausted from traveling all day and night. \\\\n\\\\nAgent: I understand, traveling overnight is never ideal. Let me check on other routes with layovers that could get you there tomorrow. Hmm, it looks like the next option is a flight leaving Chicago at 10am tomorrow morning, with a stop in Seattle. Then a 3 hour layover before the second leg to Tokyo, arriving there at 7pm tomorrow evening. I know it's not nonstop but would that timing work better for your schedule and meeting?\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: Yeah that could work I guess. At least I wouldn't be getting there in the middle of the night. What's the cost for changing my flight to that one? My meeting is at 9am so that arrival time shouldn't be too bad.\\\\n\\\\nAgent: Okay, let me take a look at pricing for that itinerary... *typing sounds* Alright, because this is a schedule change due to a cancelled flight, I'm able to reinstate you on that 10am flight to Tokyo with no additional charge. You'll still be using the same ticket. Does that work for you?\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: Really, no extra cost? That would be great then. As long as I can make my meeting, I don't want to have to cancel or reschedule. This whole thing has been such a headache. \\\\n\\\\nAgent: I completely understand your frustration. We appreciate your loyalty flying with us and really want to help get you to your meeting on time. Just give me a few minutes to process the schedule change while you grab your bag or do whatever you need to prepare for the earlier flight. Then I'll email you a confirmation with your new itinerary details. How does that sound?\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: Okay, yeah that works. Thanks for your help Alex, I feel better knowing I'll make it there in time now. I'll keep an eye out for that email. Appreciate you getting me on an earlier flight.\\\\n\\\\nAgent: You're very welcome, I'm happy I could help get you there as planned. Thank you for flying with United, and have a good rest of your day. Safe travels!\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: Thanks, you too. \\\\n\\\\nAgent: You're all set sir, flight change is complete.

I need to change the time.\\\\n\\\\nAgent: No problem, let me pull up your reservation. What's the last name the booking is under?\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: Smith. John Smith.\\\\n\\\\nAgent: Okay, let me see... Smith, John. I've got it here. What time is your current flight and what time would you like to change it to?\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: It's currently booked for 10am, but I need to push it back a few hours. Is there anything around 2 or 3pm?\\\\n\\\\nAgent: Let me check flight availability for those times. *typing sounds* Hmm, it looks like the 2pm flight is fully booked but I do have some seats available on the 3:10pm flight. Would that work?\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: Yeah, 3:10 works for me. How much would it be to change it?\\\\n\\\\nAgent: Let me take a look at the change fees... *more typing* Alright, since this is being done more than a week before your travel date the fee to change it to the 3:10pm flight will be $150 plus any difference in fare. The fare for that flight is actually $25 more than what you originally paid. So the total to change would be $150 + $25, which is $175. Does that work for you?\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: Ugh, $175 is pretty steep. You don't have anything a bit cheaper do you? I'm really trying to save some money here. \\\\n\\\\nAgent: I understand, change fees can definitely add up. Let me see if there are any other options... *typing again* Unfortunately that 3:10 flight is the only one after 10am with seats still available. I could check if there are any earlier flights that day that still have cheaper change fees if you're open to flying out earlier? Otherwise the $175 is the best option I see.\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: *sighs* Alright, I guess I don't really have a choice then. Go ahead and change it to the 3:10 flight. Can I pay over the phone?\\\\n\\\\nAgent: Sure, I'd be happy to collect payment now to complete the change. Just to confirm, I have you booked on United flight 1904 departing Chicago O'Hare at 3:10pm and arriving in Los Angeles at 5:35pm on April 15th, correct?\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: Yep, that's correct. \\\\n\\\\nAgent: Okay, great.

What's the last name the booking is under?\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: Smith. John Smith. \\\\n\\\\nAgent: Okay, got it. Let me take a look here... *typing noises* Alright, I see you're booked to fly out of O'Hare at 11am on a nonstop to LAX. What time change were you looking to make?\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: Well, I have a meeting in LA that got pushed back to 2pm instead of 12pm. So I was hoping to change the flight to maybe leave an hour or two later, if possible. \\\\n\\\\nAgent: I understand, last minute changes can be tricky. Let me check availability on later flights that day. *more typing* It looks like we have seats open on a 1pm and a 3pm departure. The 1pm flight would get you into LAX by 2:30pm. Would that work better for your schedule?\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: Hmm, yeah the 1pm flight might work. What would I need to do to change it?\\\\n\\\\nAgent: Okay, great. To change you over to the 1pm flight, I'll need to collect a $75 change fee from you. The good news is there is no increase in airfare. I can process that for you now over the phone if you'd like. \\\\n\\\\nCustomer: Alright, you can process the payment now. Uh, just one other question - if for some reason I needed to change the flight again, would I have to pay another fee?\\\\n\\\\nAgent: You're right to ask about that. Since this would be your second itinerary change on this booking, if anything else needed to be adjusted we'd unfortunately have to collect another change fee. However, if there was a delay or cancellation on our end that caused you to miss the 1pm flight, we'd of course waive any fees and rebook you. Does that make sense?\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: Yeah, that helps. Okay, go ahead and process the payment then so I can get this changed over. My credit card is Visa ending in 4231.\\\\n\\\\nAgent: Okay, just one moment while I enter that card number...*typing sounds* Alright, the payment has gone through.

When would you know if an earlier flight opens up? \\\\n\\\\nAgent: If a seat becomes available, we'll give you a call within 24 hours of your original travel date to let you know if we were able to move you. You'll need to accept or decline the new flight within an hour of us reaching out. Beyond that, your Saturday flight would be confirmed.

Are there any other flights I could switch to?\\\\n\\\\nAgent: I understand the date is important. Just give me a moment to look at some other options for you... *extended pause as agent searches their systems* Okay, it looks like we do have one seat left on an earlier flight that day. It's about 2 hours earlier than your original departure time. Would that timing work for you?\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: Yeah, that earlier flight could work. What would the cost be to switch to that one? I'm hoping to avoid any change fees if possible. \\\\n\\\\nAgent: Let me check the fare difference... *typing sounds* It looks like the fare for the new flight is only about $50 more than what you originally paid. Considering our change fees are usually around $200, I think this is a pretty good option for you. Does switching to that flight for the $50 difference sound good?\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: Yeah, I can do that. As long as it gets me on an earlier flight that day without any big fees, that works for me. \\\\n\\\\nAgent: Great, I'm happy we could find a solution for you. Just give me a second to process the change on my end... *more typing* Okay, all set! Your booking has been updated to reflect the new earlier departure time. You'll receive an email confirmation of the change shortly. Do you need anything else from me today?\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: No, I think that covers it. Thank you so much for your help, I really appreciate you finding me an option without any change fees. Have a good rest of your day!\\\\n\\\\nAgent: You're very welcome, I'm glad I could help. Safe travels and enjoy the rest of your week! Thank you for calling United, you have a great day as well.\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: Thanks, you too!

Umm, let me pull up your record here... *typing noises* Okay, it looks like your flight on the 13th was delayed due to mechanical issues.

The whole experience was a nightmare. \\\\n\\\\nAgent: I'm sorry to hear that. What seemed to be the issue with your flight?\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: Well first of all your website was a mess to book on. It kept crashing on me. Then when I got to the airport for my flight, your check-in system was down so the lines were insane. I was there for over 2 hours just to check my bag! \\\\n\\\\nAgent: Oh wow, that's definitely unacceptable. I apologize for all the technical issues. Do you have a confirmation number for your reservation so I can take a look?\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: Ugh hold on let me find it *sounds of rustling papers* okay, here it is - H17G8N. \\\\n\\\\nAgent: *typing noises* Okay, I've pulled up your reservation. Can you tell me what happened after check-in?\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: After finally checking in, I went through security which of course took forever. Then I get a notification that my flight was delayed by 3 hours! Three hours!! I had to sit around the airport for that long until we finally boarded. \\\\n\\\\nAgent: I'm really sorry to hear about all those delays. A three hour delay is certainly not okay. Was the flight at least on time once you boarded?\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: No! Of course not. We sat on the tarmac for another hour before taking off. And then to top it all off, the food they served was disgusting. I'm never flying United again if this is how you treat your customers. I want a full refund and some flight credit too for my next trip.\\\\n\\\\nAgent: Ah man, I can certainly understand why you'd be so frustrated with that entire experience. Let me take a look at some options for you compensation-wise. *typing noises* It looks like based on the multiple delays and technical issues, I can offer you a full refund of your ticket cost. I'll also be adding $500 in flight credits to your United account for your next trip. Does that sound fair to make up for everything you dealt with?\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: You know, that flight credit really isn't going to make up for how poorly I was treated. This was supposed to be a fun vacation and United ruined it. I want more than that since now I'll never want to fly with you again. \\\\n\\\\nAgent: I understand your frustration and don't blame you at all for feeling that way. Let me see if I can do a little more for you. How does a $1000 flight credit and 25,000 mileage bonus points sound on top of the full refund? I know it doesn't undo the bad experience but hopefully it shows our commitment to making it right.\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: You know what, fine that will have to do I guess. But you guys really need to get your act together if you want to keep customers. No one wants to deal with these kinds of problems. \\\\n\\\\nAgent: You're completely right, and I'll be sure to pass along the feedback to my managers. Thank you for bringing this to our attention - it's the only way we can work to improve. I'm going to process that refund and credits for you now. It may take a few business days to post to your account. Please let me know if you have any other issues.

Umm, I wanted to ask about getting a refund for that flight.\\\\n\\\\nAgent: Okay, thanks for providing the details John. Let me pull up your reservation. *typing noises* Alright, I've got your flight here. What seems to be the issue with the flight that makes you want a refund?\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: Well, ahh, the issue was that my flight got delayed by over 5 hours. I missed an important business meeting because of it. The delay put me in LA way too late. \\\\n\\\\nAgent: I see, that's definitely frustrating to deal with. Delays like that are never good. Let me take a look at the details of your flight and the reason for the delay. *more typing* It looks like there was severe weather in Chicago that day which caused many flights to be backed up. According to our policies, weather related delays do not make passengers eligible for refunds unfortunately.\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: Ugh, I was worried you would say that. The weather didn't really affect my plans though, you know? That meeting was super important for my job. Is there anything else you can do? Maybe a future travel credit or something?\\\\n\\\\nAgent: I understand your frustration, missing a big meeting because of a delay definitely isn't ideal. Let me check a few things on my end here... *typing rapidly now* It looks like we don't have any options for a direct refund in this situation. However, I'm happy to offer you a $200 travel credit that can be used on any United or United Express flight within the next 12 months. Would that work for you as a remedy?\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: Hmm, a $200 travel credit does help soften the blow a bit I guess. Alright, yeah let's do that then. At least it'll cover most of my next flight. Thanks for checking into that for me David, I appreciate you taking the time.\\\\n\\\\nAgent: You're very welcome, I'm glad we could find a solution that works for you.

As for the weather in June... it can really vary but tends to be mild. Highs are usually in the mid-70s, but you may get some warmer days up into the low 80s as well. Rain is definitely possible too, so maybe pack for a mix of sun and clouds just to be prepared. Does that help at all with your packing?\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: Yeah, that's super helpful, thanks.

Umm...\\\\n\\\\nAgent: Okay, no problem. What do you need to know about that flight? \\\\n\\\\nCustomer: Well, I was hoping to change the departure time if possible. The flight is currently scheduled to leave at 7am but I have an early meeting in LA that day and was wondering if there's any later flights available.\\\\n\\\\nAgent: Let me take a look at your booking and see what options we have. *typing sounds* Okay, it looks like the flight you're currently booked on is one of our earliest departures that day. We do have some flights later in the morning, would 10:30am or 11:15am work better for your schedule?\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: Yeah, those later times would be much better. Is it possible to switch me over to one of those without having to pay a change fee or anything? \\\\n\\\\nAgent: Let me check on that for you. *more typing* Unfortunately, because this change is being made less than 21 days before your travel date, there would be a $150 fee to swap you over to a different flight. The good news is we do have seats available on both the 10:30am and 11:15am flights if you'd like me to go ahead and process the change for you.\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: Ah man, $150 is a lot. Umm, let me think for a sec... is there any way you could maybe waive that fee just this one time since it's only a couple hours difference? I'm a pretty frequent flyer and it would really help me out.\\\\n\\\\nAgent: I understand the fee is a lot, let me see if there's anything I can do. *typing and clicking sounds* It looks like based on your history of being a loyal customer flying with us multiple times a year, I may be able to offer you a one-time courtesy waiver of the change fee. Will one of those later flights work with your schedule if I switch you over now without charging you?\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: Yeah, that would be great! The 10:30am flight would be perfect then.

Can you tell me your name and confirmation number so I can take a look at your itinerary?\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: Ugh, it's John Smith, confirmation number is A23B45C67. \\\\n\\\\nAgent: *typing sounds* Okay Mr. Smith, let me pull up your reservations...alright, it looks like your flight from ORD to EWR was delayed due to severe weather at O'Hare. The connection time between that flight and your second leg to Boston was only 50 minutes, which isn't much of a buffer if there are any delays. Hmm, let me see what options we have for getting you to Boston today instead...\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: Yeah I know it wasn't a big layover but your website said that flight has been on time like 90% of the time or something. It's just so annoying because now I have to reschedule this whole meeting. \\\\n\\\\nAgent: I understand your frustration, missing an important meeting because of a delay is never fun. *more typing* Unfortunately all of our nonstop flights from Chicago to Boston are fully booked for today. However, I could book you on a combination of flights through Detroit or Philadelphia that would get you there this evening instead. The first flight would leave in about 2 hours. How does that sound?\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: Ugh that's not really ideal but I guess it's better than nothing. What's that gonna cost me?\\\\n\\\\nAgent: Let me take a look at the fare for those routes...okay, because this is due to a delay that was within our control, I'm able to waive the difference in fare. The total for the new itinerary will be the same as what you originally paid. I'll also be adding a $150 travel voucher to your account for the inconvenience.

Does that work for you?\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: Ah man, $150 just to change the date? That's pretty steep. Do you think there's any way to waive that fee since it's only a few days difference? \\\\n\\\\nAgent: I understand the fee seems high to change it just a couple days. Let me check if there's anything I can do...*more typing and computer noises* Unfortunately with it being so close to your original travel date, the system won't allow me to waive the change fee. But maybe there's another option - would you consider postponing your travel by a week or so? If you moved it to the following Wednesday or Thursday instead, there would be no change fee charged.\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: Hmm...yeah moving it a full week might work actually. Alright, let's change it to the following Wednesday then if there's no fee.

Even if I have to stop over somewhere?\\\\n\\\\nAgent: You're right, two days won't help your original travel plans. Let me check some alternative routings...hmm it looks like I can get you out this evening but you'll have a stop in Denver. You'd land at about 10pm which may still be too late. I'm still looking at other options, just give me another minute. \\\\n\\\\nCustomer: Ah damn, 10pm would be cutting it close but maybe better than nothing. What would the cost be for that flight?\\\\n\\\\nAgent: For the redeye with the stop in Denver, the fare would be $450. I know that's more than your original ticket but hopefully still reasonable given the last minute nature. And of course I'll get you set up with a hotel voucher for your overnight in Denver. Does that work for you?\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: Ugh, $450 is still pretty pricey. You don't have anything a little cheaper? I'm just a frustrated college kid so money is tight. \\\\n\\\\nAgent: Let me take one more look here...the cheapest I can do would be to fly you out first thing tomorrow morning. It involves an early 5am departure and a few hours layover in Chicago but you'd get in around lunchtime. And the fare for that would be $300 even. I could also give you a $100 credit to use on a future United flight within the next year to help make up for some of the hassle. How does that sound?\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: You know what, that 5am flight tomorrow might work. I'll just crash at a friend's place tonight so I'm close to the airport. And the $100 credit helps. Alright, I'll take that option.\\\\n\\\\nAgent: Great, I'm happy we could find a solution that works. Let me go ahead and process that rebooking for you. The confirmation should be in your email within the next 30 minutes. And please accept my apologies again for the original delay.

Is there any way you can refund me the difference in fare since I'm getting a worse flight now?\\\\n\\\\nAgent: I can definitely understand your frustration. While we can't offer a full refund for the rescheduling due to the cancellation being outside of our control, I'd be happy to provide you with a $100 flight credit that can be used for future travel on United as a small gesture of goodwill.

Any chance there could be cancellations on those other flights between 10am and 4pm?\\\\n\\\\nAgent: You're right, 4pm does seem a bit late. There's always a possibility of seats opening up due to cancellations. Let me go ahead and put you on the standby lists for the 12pm and 1pm flights. I'll also send you emails automatically if any seats become available on those. In the meantime, you're still confirmed for the 10am flight, so if nothing changes you'd still have that option to fall back on.

Umm, is there a cost for the change or to be on the standby list? \\\\n\\\\nAgent: You're very welcome, I'm happy I could help. Since this is a schedule change within the same day of travel, there will be no additional cost to change flights or be placed on a standby list. You'll only pay the original ticket price.

Umm, my flight is tomorrow from New York to LA and it looks like it's been delayed. \\\\n\\\\nAgent: I see, thank you for bringing that to my attention. Can I get your confirmation number so I can pull up your reservation?\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: Yeah, it's BQ4381. *sounds of typing in the background* \\\\n\\\\nAgent: Okay, let me take a look here... *typing noises* Yup, I'm seeing your flight from Newark to LAX scheduled for tomorrow is currently delayed until the evening. It looks like some weather issues are causing delays across the network. I apologize for any inconvenience this causes. \\\\n\\\\nCustomer: Ugh, are you serious? This flight is super important, I have meetings in LA I have to make. Is there any way to get me on an earlier flight or get a refund? I don't want to be stuck at the airport all day.\\\\n\\\\nAgent: I understand your frustration, delays are never ideal. Let me see what options I can find for you. *typing* Unfortunately all the earlier flights are fully booked today. I could try to add you to our stand-by list in case any seats open up, but no guarantees. As for a refund, since this is a weather delay and out of our control, our policy is just a one-time change fee waiver. I'm happy to process a full refund if you'd like to cancel, but then you'd be responsible for rebooking travel on your own. \\\\n\\\\nCustomer: Ah man, this sucks. I really need to be in LA for these meetings tomorrow. Alright, go ahead and put me on the standby list then. And I guess I'll just have to risk taking the delayed flight and hope I make my meetings. This is ridiculous!\\\\n\\\\nAgent: I know, I'm sorry you're in this situation. Weather delays are never fun. Let me get you added to the standby lists for the earlier flights. *typing* Okay, you're all set on those. In the meantime, feel free to check flight statuses on the app - sometimes things clear up quicker than expected. And I'll send you a $100 travel voucher for the inconvenience. Hopefully that helps somewhat if you do end up missing your meetings. Please let me know if there's anything else I can do for you in the meantime.\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: Ugh, thanks I guess. Alright, well fingers crossed something opens up. Thanks for your help Steve. \\\\n\\\\nAgent: You're very welcome, and I hope you're able to make your meetings tomorrow.

What questions do you have about that flight? \\\\n\\\\nCustomer: Well, umm I was wondering if it would be possible to change the departure time to a little earlier in the day. The flight I'm currently booked on leaves at 4pm but I was hoping to get on a flight around noon if there's availability. \\\\n\\\\nAgent: Let me take a look at our flight schedule for that route on Friday and see what options we have. *typing noises* Okay, it looks like we have a flight departing at 12:15pm that has seats available. If you'd like I can go ahead and switch your reservation over to that flight. Just to double check, the name on the reservation is John Smith correct?\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: Yes, that's right. John Smith. And that 12:15 flight works perfect for me so I'd appreciate you switching me over to that one. \\\\n\\\\nAgent: No problem, just give me one moment while I process the change...okay it's all set! Your new flight will be departing Chicago at 12:15pm and arriving in New York at 2:25pm on the same flight number. The fare will remain the same as well. Does this work for your travel plans?\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: That's great, thank you so much for helping me change that. I really appreciate you getting me on an earlier flight. *pause* Actually, while I have you on the phone, I had one other small question.\\\\n\\\\nAgent: Of course, go ahead and ask me anything else you need. I'm happy to help.\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: So when I booked the original flight, I paid for one bag to be checked. But I think I might need an extra bag for my trip now. Would I have to pay the extra baggage fee to add another bag or is there any way to waive that since I'm an loyal customer who flies with United a few times a year? \\\\n\\\\nAgent: Let me take a quick look at your frequent flyer account info. *typing* Okay, it looks like based on the number of flights you've taken with us over the past 12 months, you've reached elite status which includes the first checked bag being free on all flights. So there would be no charge to add a second checked bag to this itinerary. The upgraded boarding and free bag benefits will kick in starting with this new flight I switched you to. Does that work for your travel plans?\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: Fantastic, that's great news then. I really appreciate you checking into that for me and all your help today, Steve. You've made this really easy.\\\\n\\\\nAgent: You're very welcome, I'm glad I could assist with changing your flight and answering your questions. Safe travels and enjoy your trip to New York!

What change did you need to make?\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: I need to change it to tomorrow! The flight I was supposed to be on last week got delayed for hours and I missed an important business meeting. And now this flight is supposed to leave at the same time? No way, there's no way I'm risking being late again. You guys need to get your act together. \\\\n\\\\nAgent: I understand your frustration sir. Unfortunately the flight for tomorrow is fully booked. The best I can do is offer you a seat on Friday's red-eye flight that will get you into LA early morning. I'll waive the change fee as a courtesy since you had issues before. How does that sound?\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: Friday?! Are you kidding me? That's completely unacceptable. I told you, I can't miss this meeting again. Ugh, this is just ridiculous customer service.

Would you like me to go ahead and change it to that date? There will be a $150 change fee since it's within 7 days of the original travel date.\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: Ah shoot, was hoping to avoid the change fee. Do you have anything the week after maybe? Or is $150 the best option? \\\\n\\\\nAgent: Let me take a look at the week after. *more keyboard typing* It looks like we've got some seats available on both the following Wednesday and Thursday with no change fees since it would be over 7 days out. Does one of those dates work better for you?\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: Yeah, let's go with the following Wednesday if there's availability. No sense in paying the fee if I don't have to. Thanks Claire!\\\\n\\\\nAgent: No problem, happy to help! Okay, I've got you switched over to the following Wednesday. The flight details will be the same departing Chicago at 10am and arriving in LA at 1pm.

Is there any way I can change my flight to leave on Friday instead of Saturday? \\\\n\\\\nAgent: Let me take a look at our Friday flights and see what options are available. *typing noises* Hmm, it looks like the only flight we have leaving on Friday is at 4pm, and it would connect through Denver instead of directly to Chicago like your current itinerary. Would that work with your change of plans?\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: Umm, yeah I think that should work. Although the connection isn't ideal. What would the cost be to switch to that flight?\\\\n\\\\nAgent: Let me check the fare difference...*more typing* Alright, to change your flight to the 4pm departure on Friday it would be an additional $150 plus any difference in fare. The Saturday flight you booked was our lowest fare class so the Friday flight would be in a higher bucket. Does that work for your budget?\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: Ah man, $150 is more than I was wanting to pay. Maybe I can look at other options too? Is there any way you could waive the change fee since it's only a day difference? \\\\n\\\\nAgent: *sighs* I understand last minute changes can be tough on the wallet. Let me see if there's any flexibility on our end given it's just one day. *puts call on hold for a few minutes* Alright, I was able to get approval from my manager to waive the change fee just this once. The $150 will still apply for the fare increase unfortunately but at least it won't be double that amount. Does that work a little better for you?\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: Yeah, that does help actually. Alright, I'll go ahead and switch to that Friday flight then. Thanks for your help Peter, I appreciate you waiving the fee.\\\\n\\\\nAgent: You're very welcome, happy I could find a solution.

At least I'll only be a little late now instead of missing the whole thing. But you know what, this is the third flight I've had issues with when traveling with United in the past year. It's really unacceptable. \\\\n\\\\nAgent: You're right, sir, three flight problems in one year is too many. I completely understand your frustration. United strives to provide reliable service but unfortunately mechanical delays and cancellations are sometimes out of our control. I apologize for the disruption this has caused you. As a show of good faith, I'd like to offer you a $150 travel voucher that is good for any United or United Express flight within the next 6 months. Hopefully this will make up for some of the inconvenience. Does that seem fair to you?\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: $150? That barely covers the cost of one flight. You guys are a huge airline, you could do a lot better than that. \\\\n\\\\nAgent: You make a fair point. Let me see if there's anything else I can do for you today above and beyond the flight change and voucher. *typing sounds* As a frequent flyer on your account, I'm showing you have Gold status with us which comes with additional benefits. I'd like to upgrade your status to Platinum for the next year at no charge. That will qualify you for priority check-in, security lane access, upgrades when available and 5,000 bonus miles each year. On top of that, I'll also add an additional $300 to the travel voucher for a total of $450. Does that package of compensation seem appropriate given the multiple delays you've experienced?

Can I get your confirmation number please? \\\\n\\\\nCustomer: Sure, it's B3D9R4. \\\\n\\\\nAgent: Okay, got it. Let me see what options are available for changing your flight to Monday... *typing noises* Hmm it looks like the direct flight on Monday is completely booked. Would you be open to connecting through Chicago instead of flying direct?\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: Umm, I'd prefer not to have a layover if possible. Are there any other flights leaving later in the day on Monday that might have seats available?\\\\n\\\\nAgent: Let me check... *more typing* It looks like there is one flight leaving Monday evening at 6:15pm that has a couple seats left in economy. Would that work with your schedule? The fare would be an additional $75 since it's a change fee.\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: Ah yeah, that evening flight could work. As long as I'd still arrive around the same time? \\\\n\\\\nAgent: Let me double check the arrival time for that flight...okay, yes it looks like the arrival time is only about 30 minutes later than your original flight on Thursday. The evening flight gets in at 9:30pm. Does that work for you?\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: Yeah, I think so. As long as it's not too late of an arrival. Can you go ahead and switch me over to that Monday evening flight then?\\\\n\\\\nAgent: Absolutely, just one moment while I process the change for you... *pretends to click around on computer* Okay, all set! Your new flight information will be departing on Monday at 6:15pm and arriving at 9:30pm. The additional $75 change fee has been charged to the card on file.

I paid a lot of money for this ticket and this is unacceptable service. *sighs loudly*\\\\n\\\\nAgent: I apologize for the frustration and inconvenience caused by the multiple delays. May I have your confirmation number so I can pull up the details of your flight? There is some noise in the background, let me just *muffled sounds* sorry, trying to shut my office door. Okay, what's the confirmation number?\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: It's BG3421P. Look I know delays happen but being stuck on the plane for so long with no updates is just poor customer service. The crew seemed clueless about what was going on too. This has really ruined my trip. \\\\n\\\\nAgent: Sorry, just one second let me pull that up...okay, I see the flight you're referring to. You're right, that flight did experience longer than expected delays both on the ground and after takeoff. Umm...let me take a look at the reason for the delays. It looks like there was weather earlier in the day that caused delays throughout the system and then your particular flight encountered an issue with the lavatory that needed repair before you could continue to your destination. I completely understand your frustration with the lack of communication during the delays. That is unacceptable. How can I assist in making up for this poor experience?\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: I want a full refund for the cost of my ticket. This has wasted a whole day of my vacation. Do you think United will give me my money back?\\\\n\\\\nAgent: Let me check into refund options for you. *typing sounds* Unfortunately our non-refundable tickets don't allow for a full refund, however given the extensive delays and issues with this particular flight, I'm going to go ahead and process a goodwill refund for the full fare amount. You'll see the credit back on the original form of payment within 7-10 business days. Will that resolve your issue for this trip? I really apologize again for everything you experienced.\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: Well a refund is better than nothing I guess. Just please don't book me on United for my return flight home, I don't want to take my chances with more delays. *sighs* Thanks for your help.\\\\n\\\\nAgent: I understand, and I don't blame you for wanting to fly a different carrier for your return.

The good news is there won't be any change fees since you're changing it more than 7 days in advance. The bad news is the fare for that Monday flight is about $50 more than what you originally paid.

As long as there's room on that flight I'd like to make the change. \\\\n\\\\nAgent: No problem, I'll go ahead and process that change for you.

Would the fee be any less then? \\\\n\\\\nAgent: Let me check Friday for you...*more typing* yeah we do have seats on the Friday flight as well. The good news is the change fee would only be $100 since it's over a week before your original travel date. Does Friday work better for your schedule?\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: Yeah Friday works, thanks for checking that Sam. Alright, go ahead and change it to the Friday then and charge me the $100 fee. Will the rest of the booking stay the same? Same flight times and all that?\\\\n\\\\nAgent: Yes sir, everything else will remain the same - just the date will be changed to this coming Friday. I've officially updated your reservation now. You'll receive an email confirmation shortly. Do you need anything else from me today?\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: No, I think that's all I needed. Thanks so much for your help, I appreciate you finding me a cheaper option. Safe travels!\\\\n\\\\nAgent: You're very welcome, happy I could help.

Is there any way I can change the date of my flight or get a refund?\\\\n\\\\nAgent: No problem, let me pull up your reservation. What's the last name on the booking?\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: Jackson. Flight number is UA1245 leaving O'hare at 10am. \\\\n\\\\nAgent: Okay, got it. *typing noises* Unfortunately that flight is non-refundable so we won't be able to give you a full refund.

Please let me know if you have any other questions!\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: Actually, while I have you on the phone is there any way I could get an upgrade to business class for the new flight? I'm willing to pay the difference.\\\\n\\\\nAgent: Sure, let me check rates for an upgrade. *pause as agent checks prices* Unfortunately business class is quite a bit more for that route. It would be an additional $400 on top of what you've already paid. Does that work for your budget?\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: Yeah, you know what, that's a little more than I was wanting to spend. I'll just stick with economy. Thanks for checking though!\\\\n\\\\nAgent: No problem, totally understand. Well I'm glad we could work out changing the date for you.

How can I help you out today?\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: Hi, yeah I'm calling because I have a flight booked from Chicago to LA next Tuesday and I'm really worried about the weather. The forecast is saying there may be some storms so I wanted to check on my options if the flight gets delayed or canceled. *sighs* I just really need to get home for a work thing.\\\\n\\\\nAgent: No problem, I understand the frustration with travel delays. Let me pull up your reservation and take a look. *typing noises* Okay, it looks like you're booked on flight 1955 departing at 3:15pm. As for the weather, it is still several days out so the forecast could certainly change. But if your flight does end up getting delayed or canceled due to weather, don't worry - there are a few options available to help get you there. *pause* First, we'll automatically rebook you on the next available United flight to LA. You wouldn't have to do anything extra on your end. We may also be able to route you through another airport if it means less of a delay. And of course, you can always get a full refund if you decide to cancel your flight instead. Does that help put your mind at ease or would you like me to look into anything else?\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: Umm yeah that helps some I guess... I just really need to be there Tuesday night. Is there any way I could get on an earlier flight just in case? I know it's last minute but I'm willing to pay more if I have to.\\\\n\\\\nAgent: Let me check on upgrading you to an earlier flight. *typing noises* Unfortunately the next few flights are all pretty full, but I do see that there is still one seat left on flight 1910 departing at 1:00pm for an additional $150 fee. Would you like me to book you on that one instead to give yourself some extra time in case of delays? I can't guarantee the weather won't affect that flight either of course, but it would get you to LA a couple hours earlier just in case.\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: Ah man, $150 is kind of steep just for the peace of mind. *sighs again* I don't know, what do you think I should do? I just can't miss anything for this work stuff on Tuesday.\\\\n\\\\nAgent: I definitely understand the hesitation around paying more. From a customer service standpoint, I think it could be worth it for your peace of mind since this work event seems important. However, $150 is $150, so let's explore one more option. Given your deadline and the chance of weather delays, how would you feel about flying into Burbank airport instead of LAX? We have room on a flight leaving at 12:15pm going directly to BUR that would only be an $80 change fee. It's a bit more of a drive from Burbank into LA but it could save you money and time versus taking a potentially delayed flight. What are your thoughts on that compromise?\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: Hmm Burbank could work I guess, as long as I'm not stuck there if that flight gets canceled or delayed too. And it's only $80 you said? Alright, let's switch me over to that 12:15 flight to Burbank then. Umm is there any chance you could waive those fees since I'm a loyal customer and this is kind of a hassle?\\\\n\\\\nAgent: I appreciate your loyalty to United and understand this isn't an ideal situation. Let me take a quick look and see if there's anything I can do on the fee. *typing* Unfortunately at this stage in the booking I don't have much flexibility, but I'm happy to get you switched over. I'll go ahead and process that $80 change fee to the 12:15pm flight to Burbank. And I'm going to add a $50 flight credit to your account as a courtesy for any future travel. Does that work for you?\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: Yeah alright, that works. Thanks for your help Adam, I feel a lot better about this trip now. Fingers crossed the weather cooperates!\\\\n\\\\nAgent: You're very welcome, I'm glad I could help ease your mind. Don't hesitate to reach back out if you have any other issues before your flight. And hopefully the weather behaves for your trip - but if not, just know we've got you covered with options. Thanks for flying United, have a great rest of your day!\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: You too, thanks again!\\\\n\\\\nAgent: You're welcome, take care!\\\\n\\\\n*call disconnect tone*\", 300.0, 300.0, 878048, \"neutral\", \"frustrated\", -0.02, 0.02, \"Upgrade\", \"Brian Villegas\", 3.0], [9426822806, 1194613318, 878048, \"2024-08-01 07:28:00\", \"2024-08-01 07:34:00\", \"2024-08-01 07:35:00\", \"\\\\n\\\\nAgent: Thank you for calling United Airlines customer service, my name is Jacob.

What questions did you have about your flight? \\\\n\\\\nCustomer: Well, ahh I was hoping to change the time of the flight. Is there anything earlier I could take? You see, my meeting in LA got moved up to Saturday morning and I'm worried 3:15pm won't give me enough time.\\\\n\\\\nAgent: I understand, that's not much time between your arrival and your meeting. Let me check flight availability for earlier in the day on Friday. *typing noises* Hmm, it looks like the only other nonstop flight we have is one leaving at 11:45am, arriving at 2:00pm. That flight is pretty full though, I only see a few middle seats left. Would you like me to try booking you on that one? There would be a change fee of $150 associated with changing your flight.\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: Ugh $150 fee is pretty steep. What other options do I have then if I can't get on the earlier flight? Could I possibly take a flight on Thursday instead maybe?\\\\n\\\\nAgent: Okay, let me check flights for Thursday. *more typing* It looks like we have some better options for you on Thursday. There's a nonstop leaving JFK at 4:30pm and arriving in LA at 7:45pm. Or there's also one with a single stop in Chicago, leaving JFK at 1:15pm and getting into LA at 5:30pm. Both of those flights would get you into LA early enough on Thursday to make your meeting. Would you like me to transfer you over to those flights?\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: Hmm the 1:15pm flight with the stop in Chicago sounds good I think. Yeah, go ahead and switch me over to that one please. I appreciate you taking a look at the different options for me.\\\\n\\\\nAgent: No problem, I'm happy I could find a better flight that works with your schedule.

Your flight is scheduled to depart next Thursday at 12:15pm from O'Hare to LAX. So you'll need to change that flight due to your illness? \\\\n\\\\nCustomer: Yeah that's right.

It's really important I fly out then. \\\\n\\\\nAgent: I understand, let me check a few other options for you. *more typing* Unfortunately the direct flight on Wednesday is booked up. However, I do see there is still availability if you're open to a connecting flight. It would have you flying from Chicago to Newark, with a 2 hour layover, before continuing on to LA. Would that routing on Wednesday be okay as an alternative?\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: Ah man, a connection sounds like such a pain. And a 2 hour layover, ugh that kinda sucks. What if I paid more, is there any way at all to get me straight onto the Wednesday direct flight? \\\\n\\\\nAgent: Let me take one more look for you. It may be a long shot, but sometimes flights open up closer to the travel date if people change their plans. *more typing and clicking* Hmm, it doesn't look like any seats have opened up yet. I can put you on our stand-by list for the Wednesday direct flight, and if any seats become available in the next few days we'd be able to get you confirmed. But of course there's no guarantee. Would you like me to add you to the stand-by list just in case?\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: Yeah, you know what, go ahead and add me to stand-by. Fingers crossed a seat opens up. And if not, I guess I'll have to suck it up and take the connection. This really throws a wrench in my plans but I appreciate you taking a look. \\\\n\\\\nAgent: No problem, I'm happy to help however I can.

I wanted to double check the departure time.\\\\n\\\\nAgent: No problem, what's the flight number? Let me pull it up. *typing sounds* Okay, I've got the flight here. What did you need to know about the departure time?\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: Well the reason I'm calling is because I'm seeing a different departure time listed on my confirmation email than what's showing up when I check the flight status on the United website. On my confirmation it says the flight leaves at 8:15am but online it's showing 8:30am. \\\\n\\\\nAgent: Umm *pause* let me take a look into this for you. *more typing* You're right, it does look like there is a discrepancy between the departure time on your initial confirmation and what is showing now. Let me double check with our system to see what the correct updated time is. Just one second...ahh okay, it looks like the departure time for that flight did get pushed back slightly. The 8:30am time that is currently displaying online is the accurate updated departure time. I apologize for any confusion caused by the difference.\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: No problem, thanks for checking on that for me. Do you know why the departure time changed? Will I still be able to make my connecting flight in San Francisco if it leaves 15 minutes later than originally scheduled?\\\\n\\\\nAgent: Let me pull up your connecting flight information too. *typing* It looks like the departure time was adjusted due to a anticipated delay in one of the inbound aircraft that day. Sometimes small schedule changes are necessary to help ensure on-time performance across our network. As for your connecting flight, based on the arrival and departure times I'm seeing here you should have enough of a layover buffer to make that flight even with the 15 minute delay. Your arriving flight is scheduled to land at 7:55am and your connecting flight to *city name removed doesn't depart SFO until 11:15am so you've got over a 3 hour layover. Does that help put your mind at ease?\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: Yes, that helps, thank you. I'm just a little anxious about missing that connection. As long as I have a good layover cushion I should be okay. I appreciate you taking the time to look into this for me and explain what was going on.\\\\n\\\\nAgent: You're very welcome, I'm glad I could provide some reassurance. United strives for on-time performance but small delays do unfortunately happen sometimes. Just be sure to check your flight status online in the days leading up to your trip as well, in case there are any further updates. But based on the schedules it looks like you have a very comfortable layover. Please don't hesitate to reach back out if you have any other questions.

And I'll have to switch planes. Is there really nothing direct earlier? This is so frustrating, your airline cancelled my flight. \\\\n\\\\nAgent: I apologize for the inconvenience, I understand the layover isn't ideal. Let me look at one more option... *more typing and mouse clicking* It's not much earlier but I do see one seat left on a flight that does ORD to LAX nonstop, departing at 11:30am. It would mean getting to the airport very early tomorrow morning but that flight should have you landing in LAX by 1:30pm. Does that possibly work or is it still too late?\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: Ugh, that's barely any better. And I'd have to wake up at like 5am to get to the airport on time. This is ridiculous, your airline cancelled my flight and now everything is so much more complicated. Is there any way you can help me out, maybe put me on an earlier flight even if it means paying more? I really need to be in LA earlier. \\\\n\\\\nAgent: I understand your frustration, sir. Let me see if there's any way I can help improve the situation. *more typing as agent searches* Unfortunately all the earlier flights are completely booked due to it being last minute. But let me check if there's any opportunity to get you upgraded...it looks like we have two open first class seats leaving at 9am that would get you into LAX by 11:30am. I can get you booked in one of those seats if you'd like, it would be an additional $250 fee since it's an upgrade being offered as a courtesy. Does that earlier time work better for your schedule?\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: You know what, fine. I really don't have another choice at this point. I'll take the upgrade to first class on the 9am flight. Just please make sure I'm actually on that flight since your airline already messed this up once. And can you do anything about that extra fee since this is your fault to begin with?\\\\n\\\\nAgent: I completely understand. Let me go ahead and process that upgrade for you now to the 9am flight. *typing noises* Okay, you're all set in seat 1A. And as an additional courtesy given the last minute changes, I've been able to waive the upgrade fee just this one time. You should receive an email confirmation shortly.

My flight number is UA108 from Chicago to San Francisco.\\\\n\\\\nAgent: Okay, let me pull that flight up. What questions do you have about it?\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: Well, I know there's been a lot of weather lately and I'm just wondering what the cancellation and delay policy is in case my flight gets delayed or cancelled.\\\\n\\\\nAgent: No problem, let me take a look at the policies for that route. *typing noises* Alright, for flights from Chicago to San Francisco, if your flight is delayed by over 3 hours or cancelled, you are eligible for a full refund or to rebook on another flight at no additional cost. The same applies if you have a connecting flight that would be missed due to the delay or cancellation. Does that help explain the options?\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: Yeah, that's helpful. I'm just a little nervous about travel delays with all the snow we've been getting. Is the forecast looking okay for next week do you know?\\\\n\\\\nAgent: Let me check the forecast for O'Hare and SFO for the dates of your travel. *more typing* Umm, it looks like the forecast in Chicago is calling for partly cloudy skies with a chance of some flurries but no major storms predicted. In San Francisco, it should be clear with highs in the mid-50s. Neither airport is expecting any major weather issues that would cause widespread delays. Of course, things can always change, but as of now it looks good. Does that provide some reassurance?\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: Yeah, that does help make me feel a bit better about it. I guess flying the day after a big storm always makes me a little nervous. As long as the airports are open, I should be okay you think?\\\\n\\\\nAgent: I wouldn't be too worried given the current forecast. Of course airports can experience delays or cancellations after storms from aircraft and crews being out of position. But based on the projected weather, I wouldn't expect any airport closures or major travel disruptions. And in the event something does come up, just remember that you have options to rebook or get a refund. Does that help? Or were you wondering about anything else for your trip?\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: No, I think that covers all my questions. Thanks so much for taking the time to look into that and help ease my nerves a bit. I appreciate you walking through all the options with me.\\\\n\\\\nAgent: You're very welcome, I'm glad I could provide some reassurance. Safe travels and I hope you have a great trip to San Francisco! Don't hesitate to call back if you have any other questions before your flight. Thanks for flying with United.\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: Will do, thanks again!

Just telling us it's delayed doesn't cut it.\\\\n\\\\nAgent: *typing sounds* Okay, I've pulled up your flight.

Not only did I miss an important meeting, but I had to spend a bunch extra on an Uber to get home really late.

Let me take a look at your customer status and see what I can offer as compensation. *typing* As an apology for the long delay and issues caused, I'd like to offer you a travel voucher for $500 that is valid for one year. We'll also refund the additional Uber expenses you incurred. How does that sound?\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: *sighs* I guess that will have to do. It still doesn't make up for the missed meeting but at least it's something. Just don't let it happen again.\\\\n\\\\nAgent: I understand, and again I apologize for the frustration.

There seems to be some noise or static, just give me one second...okay go ahead and provide the number when you're ready.\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: Yeah it's PX459264. I'm actually in Denver now but I'm really frustrated about the overnight delay, it messed up all my plans for the week. \\\\n\\\\nAgent: Got it, let me take a look here...okay I see the flight you're referring to. It looks like there was significant weather in Chicago that evening which caused delays across the board. We had to unfortunately reschedule your flight for the following morning due to the backlog. I apologize for the disruption to your travel plans. How can I help make this right for you today? \\\\n\\\\nCustomer: This is unacceptable. You guys should have had a back-up plan or something for situations like this. Because of your delay, I missed an important business meeting and had to reschedule patients at my dentist office. Is there any way you can compensate me for all the trouble this caused?\\\\n\\\\nAgent: You're absolutely right, we should have had better contingency plans in place for weather delays. I completely understand your frustration, getting delayed overnight like that is never ideal. Let me see what I can do for you...umm, it looks like your original ticket was for a direct flight, how does a $500 voucher for future travel on United sound as compensation? I'm happy to discuss other options as well if that doesn't quite cover your inconvenience. \\\\n\\\\nCustomer: *sighs* I guess $500 is better than nothing. It still doesn't make up for all the hassle but I suppose it's the best you can do.

This is such crap, how could they change my flight without even telling me? Now I've got no way to get home tomorrow.\\\\nAgent: I understand your frustration sir. The flight was likely changed due to a scheduling adjustment on our end. Unfortunately we don't always have the current contact information for passengers to notify them directly of changes. What I can do is rebook you on another flight leaving Chicago tomorrow. Will the afternoon or evening flight work better for you? \\\\nCustomer: Ugh, neither of those work for me. I've got meetings first thing Monday morning, I need to be back tonight. Can't you just put me back on my original flight?\\\\nAgent: Let me check if there are any seats still available on your original flight time. *agent is typing* Unfortunately that flight is now fully booked. The best I can do is get you on the first available flight going to New York tonight, which leaves at 8:30pm. I'd need to get you set up in a hotel as well.\\\\nCustomer: Are you kidding me? So now I have to spend the whole day in Chicago and miss half a day of work tomorrow. This is unacceptable, you guys changed my plans without even telling me.

I'd be happy to provide you with a $500 travel voucher for the inconvenience as well as covering your hotel and transportation tonight.

Just book me on that 8:30 flight already so I can get out of here.\\\\nAgent: Absolutely, let me get that flight rebooked for you now. *agent is audibly typing for over a minute* Okay, you're all set on the 8:30pm flight tonight. The hotel reservation is under your name at the Hilton Garden Inn near O'Hare and they'll have a car waiting for you at the airport tonight to take you there.

How much would it cost to change it to that flight? I'm hoping it won't be too expensive since it's only a few days difference.\\\\n\\\\nAgent: Let me check the rates. *more typing* Since you're changing it within the same week, the rate is only a $75 change fee plus any difference in fare. The fare for this Wednesday is actually $25 cheaper than your original Saturday flight. So your new total would be the original fare minus $25, plus the $75 change fee.

Yeah go ahead and change it for me then please. *baby crying in background, customer speaking softly trying to calm the baby* Sorry, my son just woke up from his nap. \\\\n\\\\nAgent: No problem at all. *laughs* I understand, I've got one at home too.

Every other airline would have given me more than this measly voucher. You guys are the worst. \\\\n\\\\nAgent: I'm really sorry you feel that way.

What questions did you have about it?\\\\n\\\\nAgent: Well ahh, I was hoping to change the time of the flight. Is there maybe an earlier flight I could take that day? The current flight doesn't land in LA until pretty late.\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: Sure, let me take a look at our flight options that day. *more typing* It looks like the only other non-stop flight to LA that day leaves at 10am, which would get you there a few hours earlier. However, that flight is looking pretty full right now. I might could get you on the list for an upgrade in case any seats open up. Would you like me to try switching you to that flight?\\\\n\\\\nAgent: Hmm, yeah if there's space on the standby list for the 10am that would be great. I'm not too picky about seats or anything, as long as I can land earlier. Would I have to pay any change fees or anything?\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: Let me check on change fees for you. *typing noises continue* It looks like for changes made within the normal cancel/change window, which this one is, there would be a $150 per ticket change fee to switch flights. The good news is, since this is an arrival time change on the same airline, as long as the new flight is within a few hours of the original departure or arrival time, the ticket itself is still useable for future travel if needed. Does that work for you then?\\\\n\\\\nAgent: Umm, yeah I think I'll go ahead and do the change then. The earlier arrival is definitely worth the fee for me. Thanks so much for checking into that for me!\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: You're very welcome, I'm happy I could help get you to LA a few hours earlier. I've gone ahead and processed the change on your reservation. You'll now be on the standby list for the 10am flight. Be sure to check your email for the updated confirmation as well. Please let me know if any other issues come up before your trip. Safe travels!\\\\n\\\\nAgent: Thank you so much, I really appreciate you taking the time.

I was wondering what United's policy is for delays and cancellations?\\\\n\\\\nAgent: Okay, let me pull up your reservation and I can go over our policies with you. What's the last name the reservation is under?\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: Johnson. It's flight number 1983, leaving O'Hare at 1:30pm.\\\\n\\\\nAgent: *typing sounds* Alright, I have your reservation here Mr. Johnson. For delays, United's standard policy is if your flight is delayed over 3 hours we will rebook you on the next available flight to your destination at no extra cost. If no flights are available that day, you can choose a full refund instead. For cancellations, if your flight is cancelled we will rebook you alternatively or provide a full refund as well. Does this help explain our options?\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: Yeah, that helps. What about like hotel and food vouchers if the delay is really long, like overnight?\\\\n\\\\nAgent: Good question. If a delay looks like it will cause an overnight stay in an airport city, United will provide hotel and meal vouchers for passengers. The vouchers are usually up to $200 total per passenger to cover a night's stay and some food. Does that make you feel better about your trip next week?\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: A little bit, yeah. It's good to know what my options are just in case. I guess that's all the questions I had, thanks for walking me through that David.\\\\n\\\\nAgent: You're very welcome. I'm glad I could help put your mind at ease. If you do end up with any delays or cancellations on your flight, be sure to let me know and I can help get you rebooked or taken care of.

What would you like to know about that flight?\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: Ah yeah so I booked the flight about a month ago but I've been having some issues come up at work and I'm not sure if I'll be able to make the flight now. I was hoping to change the date or get a refund, is that possible?\\\\n\\\\nAgent: Okay I understand, let me take a look at your booking details. *types on keyboard* What's the confirmation number for the reservation?\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: It's XC435892. *dog barking in background* Sorry about that, my neighbor's dog is being loud again. \\\\n\\\\nAgent: No worries! Alright, I've pulled up your booking. So for changing the dates, since it's within a week of travel unfortunately we can't offer a flight change without paying a change fee. However, since you booked over a month ago you are eligible for a full refund if you cancel the reservation. Does that work for you?\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: Hmm that change fee might be pretty expensive right? *sighs* I'm just not sure if the project is actually going to get delayed or not. Would it be possible to get a credit or voucher instead of a full refund maybe? That way if things do work out I could still take the flight.\\\\n\\\\nAgent: You know, that's a great suggestion. Given the situation with your work and the short notice, I'm happy to issue you a travel voucher for the full value of your ticket instead of a refund. The voucher will be valid for one year from today's date so you have some flexibility there. Does that sound good to you?\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: Wow, thank you so much John I really appreciate you working with me on this. A voucher is perfect, that really helps me out. You all at United always have such great customer service. \\\\n\\\\nAgent: You're very welcome, I'm glad I could help find a good solution for you.

Let me check some alternatives for you. *more typing sounds* It looks like I can get you on a flight leaving Wednesday at 11:15am, would that work for your schedule? \\\\n\\\\nCustomer: Hmm, Wednesday at 11:15 you said? Umm, that might be a little tight with the schedule change. Any other options around that time? I'd really like to fly out in the morning if possible. \\\\n\\\\nAgent: I understand, Wednesday mornings tend to book up fast. Just one second, let me see what else is available... *typing noises* It looks like the only other morning flight I have is leaving at 7:30am. It would require stopping in Chicago first though, and you'd land in San Francisco at 10:15am. How does that sound?\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: Ah yeah, having to stop over isn't ideal. *sighs* Alright, if that 11:15am flight is really the only direct option then I suppose I'll make it work. Go ahead and change me over to that one please. \\\\n\\\\nAgent: You got it, I'll get that changed for you now. The good news is since this is a schedule change being made more than a week in advance, there won't be any fees for the difference in fare. I'll just need to collect a $150 change fee from the original reservation. Does that work for you?\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: Yeah, $150 is fine. As long as I can make the flight work on Wednesday.

That's a huge problem for me because I've got a meeting at 4pm that I now won't make it to. \\\\n\\\\nAgent: Umm let me pull up your reservation and take a look at what happened there. *typing noises* Okay, it looks like that flight did get rescheduled due to some maintenance issues we're having with that aircraft.

Or I could also try to get you on a flight out of O'Hare instead if that's an easier airport for you. I want to try and help fix this as best I can.\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: Ugh, I was supposed to fly out of Midway though, traveling out of O'Hare would be a big hassle too. Don't you have any earlier flights that day I could switch to so I don't miss my meeting? Or maybe even fly out the day before?\\\\n\\\\nAgent: Let me check on those options...hmm it looks like the only earlier flight that day is booked full unfortunately. I'm not seeing any seats open on flights tomorrow either. Hang on one second, let me check one more thing... Ah yes, it looks like we do have two seats left on a 12:30pm flight out of Midway instead of the 1pm. I can switch you over to that one at no extra charge. Does that work better for your schedule?\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: 12:30pm would be cutting it close but I suppose it's better than missing the meeting altogether. Alright, go ahead and switch me to that flight then. And are you sure there's nothing else you can offer me for all this trouble?\\\\n\\\\nAgent: I'm glad we could find a solution that works a little better for you. And you're right, I do want to offer you something further for the inconvenience. Let me credit your account with a $100 travel voucher that can be used on a future United flight. I hope that helps make up for some of the hassle this change caused. Does that sound fair to you?\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: Yeah, I suppose $100 is better than nothing.

I do see that American and Delta both have flights within the next few hours, would you like me to book you on one of those as a alternate route? We would provide a full refund for the delayed United flight.\\\\nCustomer: Ugh, fine book me on the American that leaves the soonest. But you better be giving me some kind of compensation for this huge inconvenience! I've wasted half my day just sitting in this airport. \\\\nAgent: I completely agree, you definitely deserve compensation for all these delays. Let me go ahead and book you on the 6pm American flight to Chicago and I'll also voucher you for a free roundtrip ticket for up to $500 to use within the next year as well as 6,000 award miles on your United account that you can use for an upgrade or future travel. Please let me know if there's anything else I can do for you today to help make this right.\\\\nCustomer: Whatever, just email me the new flight info and vouchers. This has been the worst travel experience, you guys really need to get your shit together over at United. \\\\nAgent: I understand your frustration and I apologize again for all the issues with your flight. Thank you for flying with us and I hope the rescheduled flight with American goes smoothly. You should receive the documentation of your new flight and compensation vouchers via email within the next hour. Thanks again for your patience and for calling United, please travel safely.\\\\nCustomer: Yeah, we'll see how long it takes to actually get those emails. I better not have any other problems or there will be hell to pay. *hangs up phone angrily*\\\\nAgent: Thank you for understanding, have a good evening. *releases heavy sigh and rolls eyes* Next!\\\\n\\\\nHow was that?

I just wanted to double check a few details about the booking.\\\\n\\\\nAgent: No problem, glad to assist. What flight details did you need to check?\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: The booking reference is X45T6G. I just wanted to make sure the booking is still there and that everything looks okay with it. Umm, also wanted to ask about checking bags for the flight.\\\\n\\\\nAgent: Okay, let me pull up your booking. *typing noises* Alright, I've got the booking here under your name and the reference number you provided. The flight is still confirmed for next Friday, departing O'Hare at 11:15am and arriving in London Heathrow at 6pm. You've got an aisle seat in economy. In terms of checked bags, the first bag is included in the fare and any additional bags would be $100 each way. Does that all sound correct?\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: Yeah that all looks good, thanks for checking. Ah, one other thing - I noticed the flight time changed a little while back. I think it was originally scheduled to depart at 10:45am, did that change get updated on my booking okay?\\\\n\\\\nAgent: Let me double check the flight history... *more typing* Yep, you're right - the flight was originally scheduled to depart at 10:45am but it got moved to an 11:15am departure in January. The good news is we did update that change on your booking automatically. So you're still confirmed to fly out at the new 11:15am time next Friday. Does that work for your travel plans?\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: Yeah that time still works for me, thanks for confirming. Umm... is there a way I could potentially get upgraded to premium economy or business class if any seats open up closer to the date? I'd be willing to pay the difference.\\\\n\\\\nAgent: Absolutely, we can put a waitlist on your booking to be notified of any upgrades that may become available. There's no guarantee, but sometimes seats do free up. I've just added the waitlist request - if a premium seat opens up within two weeks of travel, we'll contact you with the upgrade price offered. You'd have 24 hours to take the upgrade if offered. Does that sound good?\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: Yeah, that sounds great. I'll keep my fingers crossed. Well I think that covers everything I needed to check on today. Thanks so much for your help Steve!\\\\n\\\\nAgent: You're very welcome, I'm glad I could assist with your booking details and questions. I hope you have a wonderful flight and travel.

My name is Sam Johnson.\\\\n\\\\nAgent: Okay Sam, let me pull up your reservation. What change did you need to make?\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: Umm, I need to change the date of my flight from next Thursday to this coming Monday. The reason is something came up at work and I need to travel earlier than planned. Is that possible to do?\\\\n\\\\nAgent: Let me take a look at availability for Monday. *types on keyboard* It looks like there is still space on the flight to your destination on Monday. It will be a direct flight leaving at 10:30am and arriving at 1:30pm. Does that work with your schedule?\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: Yeah that time would work great. Can you let me know what the change fee would be to switch to that flight? Ah also, would I get any flight credits since I'm changing my plans earlier?\\\\n\\\\nAgent: Let me check the rules for your ticket. *more keyboard typing* It looks like since you are changing your plans more than 14 days in advance, there will be a $150 fee per ticket to make the change. Unfortunately no flight credits would apply in this case since you purchased a non-refundable ticket. Does that fee work for you?\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: Hmm, $150 does seem a little steep just for changing the date. Is there any way you could potentially waive that fee since this is only a one day difference? I'm a very loyal United customer and fly with you guys multiple times a year.\\\\n\\\\nAgent: I understand the fee feels high for such a minor change. Let me see if there's anything I can do... *puts call on hold for a minute* I was able to pull a few strings and get the change fee waived just this one time as a courtesy.

Yes, moving my flight to that Monday works perfect. You've saved me a headache at work, so I appreciate the customer service.\\\\n\\\\nAgent: You're very welcome, I'm glad I could help get you switched over to the new date.

I'm calling about my recent flight from Chicago to New York.\\\\n\\\\nAgent: Hi John, my name is Sarah. How can I help you today?\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: I just want to complain about the terrible service I received on my flight last weekend. The flight was delayed by over 2 hours with no explanation given. Then when we finally boarded, I was given a middle seat between two large passengers who kept bumping into me the entire flight. It was the worst flying experience I've ever had.\\\\n\\\\nAgent: I'm sorry to hear you had such a poor experience, John. A two hour delay is definitely unacceptable. Umm, let me pull up the flight details and see if I can get any explanation for the delay. *typing sounds* It looks like there was severe weather in the Chicago area that caused multiple flights to be grounded that day. I know weather delays are never any fun when you're just trying to get to your destination. As for the seating issue, that's definitely frustrating to be squeezed in the middle like that. *pause* Unfortunately we can't control how passengers choose to sit themselves once onboard. Let me see if there's anything I can offer you by way of an apology for the troubles.\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: I don't want any dumb voucher, I want a refund for the full cost of my ticket. The flight itself was a nightmare, and then I missed dinner plans with my family because of the delay. United needs to do better.\\\\n\\\\nAgent: I completely understand your frustration, sir. We aim to provide every customer with a pleasant and timely travel experience. Let me take a closer look at your itinerary and see if there's any way I can process a full refund. *typing noises* Unfortunately our policy is only to provide refunds for cancelled flights, not for delays outside of the carrier's control like weather. However, as a gesture of goodwill, I'm happy to offer you a travel voucher for 50% of the ticket value that doesn't expire for one year. You can use it on any United or United Express operated flight. I know it's not ideal, but will that help make up for some of the troubles you experienced?\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: 50% is not good enough. You guys really dropped the ball here and ruined my weekend. Umm, ahh, I don't know... *long pause* okay, fine, I'll take the 50% voucher. But I better be able to use it for any first class seat with no blackout dates. Your front line staff really needs more training on customer service too.\\\\n\\\\nAgent: I'm glad we could come to a resolution that works for you, even if it's not ideal. Let me go ahead and issue that $50% travel voucher to you with unrestricted first class usage and no blackout dates. You should see that in your account within the next 24 hours. And thank you for the feedback about customer service - we're always looking for ways to improve the experience. I appreciate you taking the time to share your perspective today. Please feel free to reach back out if you have any other issues during future travels. And I hope you have a better experience next time you fly with us.\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: All right, thanks I guess.

Let me check if there is any possibility to waive off the change fee due to the short notice. *types for 30 seconds* Unfortunately our policy does not allow me to waive off the fee in this situation.

I'd be happy to go ahead and process an upgrade for both you and your wife to those seats for $50 each. Then for your return flight next week, unfortunately those upgraded economy seats are all booked up already. But let me check one other thing...*typing some more* Okay, it looks like we do have two empty seats in the main cabin extra section available, which have even more legroom than economy plus. I can upgrade you both to those seats for just $75 each since it is a special occasion. Does that work for your anniversary celebration?\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: Wow, thanks so much Sam. Yeah, let's go ahead and do the upgrades, that would be great. I really appreciate you checking into that for us.\\\\n\\\\nAgent: You're very welcome, it's my pleasure. Just give me a moment to process those upgrades for you...*clicking of keyboard and mouse* Alright, all set! I've gone ahead and updated both of your tickets with the upgraded seating. You should see the new seats reflected on your itineraries online and mobile app. Please let me know if you have any other questions at all before your trip. And again, congratulations on 10 years of marriage! I hope you both have a wonderful anniversary trip.\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: Thank you so much, I really appreciate you taking the time. You've been super helpful. I think we're all set now. Have a good rest of your day!\\\\n\\\\nAgent: You're very welcome, I'm glad I could help. You both enjoy your flights and anniversary celebration. Safe travels, and thanks for calling United!\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: Thanks Sam, talk to you later.

How may I help you?\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: Hi, yeah I'm calling because I have a flight booked from Chicago to San Francisco next Thursday and I'm worried it's gonna get canceled. I've been seeing all these news reports about delays and cancellations.\\\\n\\\\nAgent: I understand your concern sir. Delays and cancellations have unfortunately been more common recently. Let me take a look at your reservation and I'll be able to give you a better idea of what to expect. May I have your confirmation number please? \\\\n\\\\nCustomer: Ugh, let me find it... *rustling papers* okay, it's UA12384920.\\\\n\\\\nAgent: *typing sounds* Okay, I'm pulling up your flight now. Your flight from Chicago to San Francisco is scheduled for next Thursday, July 14th departing at 3:45pm. Based on our flight schedules and operations for that day, it is currently still on time to depart as scheduled. However, I would recommend signing up for flight notifications just in case there are any changes. That way you'll receive an email or text if the status updates.\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: Ugh, I just feel like it's not gonna happen you know? With everything going on I don't wanna take the chance of getting stuck in Chicago. Is there any way I can change my flight or get a refund?\\\\n\\\\nAgent: I understand the uncertainty is frustrating. Let me take a look at alternative flight options for you just in case. *typing sounds* Unfortunately, that Thursday flight is pretty full so changing to another date may require an upgrade fee. I'm also not seeing any direct non-stop flights available with seats left. As for a refund, since your flight is still scheduled as planned, our policy is only to provide refunds if the flight is canceled or significantly delayed by the airline. However, let me check if we have any goodwill credits I could apply as reassurance since I know the current travel environment has folks on edge. One moment please...\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: Ugh this is so annoying. I just wanna make sure I actually make it to SF like I need to.\\\\n\\\\nAgent: I completely understand your frustration sir. Just bear with me one moment while I review some options...Okay, it looks like I can offer you a $100 travel credit that could be used for future travel on United within the next 12 months. While it doesn't get you refunded for this specific trip, it does provide some reassurance and flexibility if anything does come up to change your plans last minute. Would applying that credit to your itinerary help provide you some peace of mind?\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: You know what, yeah I think that'll make me feel a bit better. At least then if it does get canceled I won't be totally out of luck, you know? Alright, yeah go ahead and add that credit for me please.\\\\n\\\\nAgent: Absolutely, one moment while I apply that credit for you...there, all set! The $100 travel credit has now been added to your reservation. And again, please do sign up for flight notifications on our website or through our app just to be on the safe side. But based on what I'm seeing now, your flight is still scheduled as planned. Hopefully this helps put your mind at ease a bit. Let me know if there's anything else I can do for you today!\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: Thanks, I appreciate you helping work something out for me there. Yeah hopefully it all goes smoothly. Alright, well thanks for your time.\\\\n\\\\nAgent: You're very welcome, I'm glad we could provide a little reassurance. Safe travels and enjoy your trip to San Francisco!

This is unacceptable! \\\\n\\\\nAgent: *typing noises* Okay, I see the issue. There was some bad weather in Chicago this morning that caused delays for multiple flights. Just give me a second to review our policies for long delays...ahh okay, for a delay of over 3 hours we offer a full refund of your ticket cost. We can also provide a $300 travel voucher for future United flights. How does that sound?\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: Are you kidding me? $300 is nothing, this delay caused me to miss an important business meeting. I want more than that. \\\\n\\\\nAgent: I understand the delay caused you to miss your meeting, that's never ideal. Unfortunately the $300 voucher is the maximum we offer according to our customer commitment policies. I could credit your United MileagePlus account with 15,000 bonus miles if that would help at all?\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: This is such bullshit. You guys lose me as a customer if that's all you're offering. Let me talk to your supervisor.\\\\n\\\\nAgent: I'm sorry you're still not satisfied sir. Let me transfer you to a supervisor and hopefully they can further assist. One moment please while I connect you... *holding music*\\\\n\\\\nSupervisor: Thank you for holding, this is John. How can I help resolve your issue today?\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: I want compensation for real for all the hassle your dumb delay caused me. Your agent said the best they can do is $300 voucher but that's a joke. \\\\n\\\\nSupervisor: I understand your frustration sir. Delays are never easy, especially when it impacts important plans. Let me take a look at the details of your flight and see if there's anything else I can offer to improve your experience with us. Hmm...it looks like due to the length of the delay and that you're a frequent flyer customer, I may be able to offer a $500 travel voucher as a one-time courtesy. Would that help make up for some of the trouble?\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: Throw in a free first class upgrade on my next flight and you've got a deal. I spend a lot on United and don't want this hurting my loyalty to your airline.\\\\n\\\\nSupervisor: I think we can make that work for you just this once then. How does a $500 travel voucher and one free domestic first class upgrade on your next flight within the next 6 months sound? \\\\n\\\\nCustomer: Alright fine, I guess that will have to do. Just don't let something like this happen to me again.\\\\n\\\\nSupervisor: You have my word we'll do everything possible to avoid delays like this impacting your travel again.

Flight 1898 from New York to Chicago was delayed due to maintenance issues. Unfortunately these things do happen from time to time. Let me see what I can do for you...*more keyboard clicks* It looks like we have openings on flights going out tonight and tomorrow, would any of those work for you?\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: Tonight would be fine I guess, but I'm missing a big client meeting today because of this. Is there any way I can get compensated? These delays are really costing me. \\\\n\\\\nAgent: I understand your frustration sir. *sighs* Unfortunately we don't offer compensation for first delays, only cancellations. I can get you booked on a flight tonight that will get you into Chicago by 8pm, but that's really the best I can do at this point. \\\\n\\\\nCustomer: That's unacceptable. Three delays in a month is ridiculous. *voice rising* I want to speak to a supervisor.\\\\n\\\\nAgent: Sir, I understand you're upset but raising your voice won't solve anything.

Let me check if there are any earlier flights available to get you to Denver on time for your meeting. *more typing* Unfortunately it looks like all other flights for the rest of the day are now full due to the high number of guests being rerouted from cancelled flights. In this situation let me offer you a full refund for your original ticket, and I'll also provide you with a $200 travel voucher for your next United booking as a courtesy.

It's just annoying because now I have to reschedule my whole meeting and find a last minute flight on a different airline.\\\\n\\\\nAgent: I completely understand your frustration, missing a meeting because of travel issues is never fun. Is there anything else I can help with while rebooking your travel, like assisting with finding an alternate flight or contacting the rental car company?

I looked quick on other sites but everything was booked or insanely expensive.\\\\n\\\\nAgent: No problem, let me pull up our partners and see what options there are. *more typing and clicking* It looks like American Airlines has a direct flight leaving Chicago at 8:15pm and arriving in Denver at 10:21pm. Would that work timing-wise to still make your meeting tomorrow? The fare is $450 but I can have it price matched to your original United fare of $300 since this is due to a cancellation.\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: You know what, that American flight will work. As long as I can get there tonight instead of waiting until 10pm on United, I'll take it. Can you book that for me please?\\\\n\\\\nAgent: Absolutely, I'm happy I could find an alternate flight that still gets you there in time. I've gone ahead and booked you on that American flight, the confirmation number is YT3982. Please let me know if you need any other assistance in getting to your meeting tomorrow.

Thank you for flying with us and let me know if there's anything else I can help with today!\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: Thank you, I appreciate you helping me out with this change. You know, the last time I flew United a few months ago, I wasn't super impressed with the experience. The flight was delayed for hours and I missed my connection. Has United been on time more lately or is it still an issue?\\\\n\\\\nAgent: You're very welcome, I'm glad I could help get you switched to the earlier flight. As for on-time performance, it's been a bit of a mixed bag unfortunately. The winter weather definitely caused some delays in January and February. But we've seen improvements in March and April. Our latest stats show around 78% of flights arrived within 15 minutes of schedule. I know that still leaves room for delays though. We're definitely working on improving reliability. If your return flight from Denver ends up delayed, be sure to let me know - I can try to help get you rebooked or get you some compensation for the inconvenience.\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: Yeah, 78% still seems low to me. But I guess that's the airline business - it's never perfect. I just wanted to check in case it was still really bad before I committed to flying United again. But if you say it's a bit better, I guess I don't have much choice since this was the only flight that worked with my schedule. Umm, is there anything else you can do to help make up for a possible delay, like any upgrades available or something? Since I had issues last time.\\\\n\\\\nAgent: You're right, delays are unfortunately part of flying sometimes. Let me take a quick look and see if there are any complimentary upgrade options I could apply as a courtesy for the potential delay issue... *more typing* It doesn't look like we have any complimentary upgrades available on that route right now since it's fairly short notice. But I can credit your account with 2,000 bonus miles as a gesture of goodwill. That should cover a future flight snack or drink, or maybe part of another ticket someday. Does that sound fair to help make up for the last experience? I'm happy to see what other options might be out there as well.\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: You know, 2,000 miles does seem a bit on the low side considering the hassle of missing my connection last time. And now having to pay that change fee. Any chance you could bump that up at all? I'm still a little hesitant to fly United again if things might go wrong.\\\\n\\\\nAgent: You make a fair point. Let me take a second look here...Okay, how about 5,000 bonus miles instead? I know it still may not fully make up for the hassle, but hopefully it shows our commitment to taking care of loyal customers. And of course, feel free to reach back out if you experience any issues on the return flight - I'll do my best to get you rebooked promptly.

Can you provide me with your confirmation number so I can take a look at what happened with that flight? There was some bad weather across the midwest yesterday that impacted a number of flights.\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: Yeah the confirmation number is G743T9. I understand weather delays happen but 3 hours is ridiculous. Because of this I lost a big client and it's really hurting me financially. \\\\n\\\\nAgent: Let me pull up your reservation...okay yes I'm seeing your Chicago to LA flight was delayed due to thunderstorms in Chicago. The flight sat on the tarmac for over 2 hours waiting for a break in the storms before being able to take off. I completely understand how frustrating and inconvenient that must have been for you, missing your meeting. Umm, let me take a look at some options for how I might be able to help make this right for you. *typing noises* What class of service were you flying?\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: I was in economy. And I don't want another flight voucher, those things are useless to me now that I've lost this client. I need actual compensation for my lost wages and contract. This delay cost me over $10,000 so United needs to pay up.\\\\n\\\\nAgent: I understand your frustration, sir, but unfortunately I don't have the ability to provide compensation in that amount. Let me see what I can do in terms of upgrading your frequent flyer status or providing you with miles you can use for a future trip. Would flying in first class on your next trip with us help at all to make up for this experience? I know it doesn't fully repay the financial loss but may help improve your next travel with us. And I'll credit your account with 15,000 bonus miles as a show of good faith.\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: First class would be nice but it doesn't make up for losing a client. This is unacceptable service from United. Is there anyone higher up I can talk to because you're clearly not able to help. \\\\n\\\\nAgent: I understand sir, let me transfer you to a manager who may have more flexibility to see what can be done in this situation. Please hold for just a moment while I transfer the call. *holds music plays for 40 seconds* \\\\n\\\\nManager: Thank you for your patience, this is Amanda the duty manager. I understand the significant delay you experienced has caused you financial loss and I sincerely apologize for that. In situations like this where contractual obligations are affected, we do have policies to properly compensate customers. If you can provide documentation of the lost contract and wages, I am authorized to offer you a one-time $5,000 goodwill payment to acknowledge the impact. Please email those documents to me and I'll make sure the claim is processed. Beyond that there may be options to negotiate in terms of future travel if needed also. How does that sound as a starting offer?\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: *sighs* You know, I'm still not happy about it but $5,000 will at least cover some of what I lost. Alright, I'll send over the documents. This better not happen again though or I'll be taking my business elsewhere. \\\\n\\\\nManager: I fully understand and thank you for your patience today. Please go ahead and email those over and I'll take care of the rest. And rest assured we'll be reviewing what led to such a lengthy delay to see how we can improve.

Can I get your last name please? \\\\n\\\\nCustomer: Yep, it's Johnson. J O H N S O N.\\\\n\\\\nAgent: Alright, let me take a look here...Johnson, flight from Chicago to LA next Thursday. *keyboard clicking sounds* Okay, it looks like there was a schedule change to that flight. The departure time has been pushed back by about an hour. It now leaves Chicago at 2:15pm instead of 1:20pm. The arrival time in LA is the same at 5:10pm. Does that match with what you were seeing?\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: Ah yeah that does match what I saw on the website. *sigh* Not ideal having to leave later but as long as the arrival time isn't changed I guess it's not the end of the world. *background noise* Sorry, my kid is yelling in the background. \\\\n\\\\nAgent: No problem, I understand. Kids are always keeping us on our toes! At least the arrival time is still the same so it shouldn't disrupt any plans you have when you land. Is there anything else I can do for you today to help with your travel?\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: Umm, yeah actually while I have you on the phone there was one other thing. I'm trying to book another flight from LA to Boston the following Monday. When I search online, it's only showing me connecting flights and nothing direct. Do you happen to know if United flies direct between those two cities?\\\\n\\\\nAgent: Let me check on that route for you. *typing sounds* Okay, taking a look at our schedule for flights from LA to Boston the following Monday...it doesn't look like we have any non-stop or direct flights operating on that date. United does fly direct between LA and Boston on most days, but it looks like maintenance that week is limiting our aircraft, so the only options showing are the one or two stop connecting flights. Would you like me to take a look and see if I can find you the most timely connecting option?\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: Ah yeah if you don't mind taking a look, that would be great. I'd prefer not to have to connect if possible but I know it's not always avoidable. No big rush though, just wondering if anything pops up that's reasonably direct.\\\\n\\\\nAgent: No problem, let me pull up our flight schedules. *longer pause as agent searches schedules* Hmm, it looks like the best option I'm seeing would be to connect through Denver. The flights would be LA to Denver, about a 3 hour layover, and then Denver to Boston arriving around 9:30pm that day. The total travel time would be around 9 hours. I know that's still a bit of a journey with the layover, but it's one of the more direct routings I'm seeing that day unfortunately. Would you like me to book that for you or keep looking at other options?\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: You know, that Denver connection doesn't actually sound too bad given the limited options. As long as I'm not stuck in the airport for like 8 hours I think I can deal with a 3 hour layover. Why don't we go ahead and book that one? I appreciate you taking the time to look.\\\\n\\\\nAgent: You're very welcome, I'm glad I could find something somewhat workable for you given the schedule that week. Okay, I've gone ahead and booked you on those flights from LA to Boston with the connection in Denver. Your confirmation number is X4CRZ9. Please let me know if you need any other changes or have additional questions! Is there anything else I can assist with today?\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: No, I think that's all I needed. Thank you so much for your help, I really appreciate you checking on that schedule for me and finding a decent option.

So how would I go about changing it? \\\\n\\\\nAgent: No problem, to change your flight to the 5pm flight tomorrow all I need you to do is pay the difference in fare. The new price is going to be an additional $150. Does that work for you?\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: Hmm $150 more? That's a bit more than I was hoping to pay. Is there any way you could waive the change fee or give me a discount since it's a family emergency?\\\\n\\\\nAgent: I understand the situation and I apologize for the increase. Unfortunately with it being such a last minute change our policies won't allow me to waive the change fee. Let me check really quickly if there's anything I can do to help offset the cost a little... *more typing and clicking* You know, I might be able to give you a $50 credit to put towards the difference. I know it's not a full waiver but it's the best I can offer under these circumstances. Does that work for you?\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: You know what, $50 off is better than nothing. Alright, I'll take that flight then. How do I pay the difference?\\\\n\\\\nAgent: Thank you for understanding. I'll go ahead and process the change of flight for you now. To pay the $100 difference just go ahead and read me your credit card number and the expiration date. Once that's processed you'll receive an email confirmation with your new flight details.\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: Okay, sounds good.

First, it was delayed for over two hours with no explanation. Then when we finally boarded, they didn't have enough room for all the bags so they had to gate-check a bunch. Including mine! When I landed, my bag was totally destroyed. \\\\n\\\\nAgent: Oh man, that does sound incredibly frustrating. *types into computer* Let me pull up your flight details and take a look. *pause* It looks like there was severe weather in Chicago that caused multiple flight delays across the board.

Let me check our refund policies for your specific fare. *more typing* Unfortunately because you booked this ticket within 14 days of departure, it is non-refundable. The best I can offer is a one-time change to the ticket for a $200 fee, and any difference in fare for the new dates. Would you like me to check availability for any alternate travel dates?\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: Ugh that's a bummer. *sighs* Okay yeah, go ahead and check some other dates. Probably sometime in early June would work better for me now. What do you have available? And is that $200 change fee my only option?\\\\n\\\\nAgent: Let me pull up our June schedules. We have flights on the 2nd, 5th, 8th, 11th or 14th that go directly from New York to San Francisco. As for the fee, I'm afraid $200 is the lowest we can waive it down to since this change is within the non-refundable period. Does any of those June dates work well for your new travel plans? \\\\n\\\\nCustomer: You know, those dates still aren't 100% certain either with how things keep changing. And $200 is a lot to pay just to change it. Is there any way you could make an exception just this one time since my plans fell through? It's really not my fault things keep getting rescheduled.\\\\n\\\\nAgent: I understand your frustration, and I wish there was more flexibility since this is out of your control. However, our change policies do have to apply consistently to be fair to all our customers. The best I may be able to offer as a one-time courtesy is to credit the $200 fee towards a future flight, but I cannot waive it outright. Would using a credit instead of paying the fee now work for you to reschedule this trip?\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: You know, this is just so inconvenient. I think instead of changing dates again, I'm just going to have to cancel this flight. It's really not worth all the hassle and costs at this point. Is there any way you can give me a partial refund instead of nothing?\\\\n\\\\nAgent: I apologize for the inconvenience. Unfortunately our non-refundable fares do not offer any money back once purchased within that timeline. However, I'd be happy to issue you a credit for the full amount of the ticket valid for one year. That way if your travel plans firm up again in the next 12 months, you won't have to pay for the ticket cost all over. Does that work as a better solution than fully canceling with no refund or credit?\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: You know, a full credit does sound better than nothing I guess. Alright, go ahead and issue that then if that's the best option. This has just been a big headache but I appreciate you working with me Sarah.\\\\n\\\\nAgent: I'm glad we could find an acceptable solution for you. Thank you for your patience and understanding as well. Expect to see the full credit issued to the original form of payment within the next 7-10 business days.

I could try to add you to our standby list in case any seats open up, but no guarantees there. As for a refund, since this was due to a mechanical issue and not something within our control, our policy is just to provide a complimentary meal voucher for the delay. However, I'm happy to credit your account with $200 as a goodwill gesture for the inconvenience. Does that help at all?\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: Ugh $200 isn't really going to make up missing these important meetings. And being on standby still means I might not make it, you know? This is really messing with my business. Is there any way you can get me on a flight today instead of waiting until tomorrow? I'd be willing to pay more if I need to. I just really need to be there today. \\\\n\\\\nAgent: Let me take another look here. You're right, missing meetings due to the delay is a much bigger inconvenience than a voucher or credit can make up for. *more clicking* It looks like we do have one option available today, though it would require a layover and would be quite a bit more expensive since it's such short notice. There's a flight leaving JFK in 3 hours with a layover in Chicago, then continuing on to LA that would get you there this evening. The upgrade to get on that flight would be an additional $800 on top of what you've already paid. I know that's a lot, but would getting there today be worth it to avoid missing your meetings?\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: Ugh $800 is steep but you're right, missing these meetings would be really bad. Alright yeah go ahead and upgrade me to that flight today. I'll take the layover if it means I can still make my meetings. Just charge my card on file then. Thanks for your help, I appreciate you getting me on an earlier flight.\\\\n\\\\nAgent: No problem, I'm happy I could find a solution for you.

What days were you looking to change it to?\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: Umm, yeah that's right. Is there any way I could fly out on Monday instead? I know it's really short notice to change it but it would really help me out.\\\\n\\\\nAgent: Let me check availability for Monday. *typing noises* It looks like we do have seats available on a flight leaving Chicago at 1:15pm arriving in Denver at 3:25pm on Monday. The good news is I can make that change for you. The bad news is there will be a $150 fee to change it since this is within 7 days. Does that work for you?\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: Ah man, $150 is pretty steep... is there any way you could waive that fee since it's such short notice? Money is a little tight right now with everything else going on. \\\\n\\\\nAgent: I understand the fee is a lot, let me see if there's anything I can do. *more typing* Unfortunately since it's within the 7 day timeframe, there's no flexibility on my end to waive the fee. I'm happy to take a look at other date options further out if there's a chance any of those could work better for you without the change fee.\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: Hmm, that's too bad. *sighs loudly* I guess I don't really have another choice then if I need to travel on Monday. Alright, go ahead and change it then please. Can I pay the fee with a credit card over the phone?\\\\n\\\\nAgent: Sure thing, I'm just updating your reservation now with the new Monday flight. Then I'll be ready to collect the change fee payment when we're all set. Just one moment...okay, all set on this end! If you want to read back the new flight details before we proceed with payment.\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: Thanks, yeah go ahead and read them back. *dog barking in background*\\\\n\\\\nAgent: No problem. Your new flight is departing Chicago O'Hare at 1:15pm on Monday, arriving in Denver at 3:25pm the same day. Return flight leaves Denver on Thursday at 5:30pm arriving back in Chicago at 8:45pm. Does that all look correct?\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: Yup, that works. Sorry about the dog! Alright, go ahead and run my credit card then please. You've been very helpful dealing with this last minute change.\\\\n\\\\nAgent: You're very welcome, I'm glad we could work it out. If you'll just read me your credit card number, expiration date and 3 digit code on the back we'll get that fee taken care of. After that you'll be all set with your new itinerary. Thank you for flying United!\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: Sounds good, the card is... *conversation continues with payment details* Thank you so much for your help, I really appreciate you being able to change my flight. Have a good rest of your day!\\\\n\\\\nAgent: You're most welcome, I'm happy I could assist. Safe travels and enjoy your trip to Denver!

Okay, I see the reservation.

Would that work better for you?\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: Hmm, 3pm could work but is there anything later in the evening maybe? I have a meeting in SF that was rescheduled to the afternoon so the later the better.  \\\\n\\\\nAgent: Sure, no problem, let me check...the latest flight we have that day leaves at 8pm. How does that sound?\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: The 8pm flight would be perfect. Can you switch me over to that one?\\\\n\\\\nAgent: Yeah, I can definitely switch you to the 8pm flight. Just want to double check, the name on the reservation is John Smith and the contact number is still the same, right? \\\\n\\\\nCustomer: Yup, all the information is correct. My number hasn't changed.\\\\n\\\\nAgent: Great, I'm making the change to your flight now. The 8pm flight will be all set. Since this is a schedule change, there will be a $100 fee to process it. Will you be paying with the same credit card on file?\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: Ah man, $100 fee is a bit much. Umm, is there any way you can waive that since I'm Gold status with you guys? It's a work trip so they're paying anyway.\\\\n\\\\nAgent: *typing* Let me take a quick look at your account. Yep, I see you're Gold status which comes with some perks. As a one-time courtesy, I'll be able to waive the change fee for you today. The flight will be switched over to 8pm at no additional cost. Does that work for you?\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: Wow, thanks so much Jake I really appreciate you doing that. You just saved me a hundred bucks!\\\\n\\\\nAgent: You're very welcome, happy to help out.

Umm, I've been feeling a bit under the weather lately and was wondering if there's any way to change my flight.\\\\n\\\\nAgent: No problem, let me take a look at your booking. What's the name the reservation is under? \\\\n\\\\nCustomer: It's booked under John Smith. The flight is next Thursday, departing Chicago O'Hare at 1pm.\\\\n\\\\nAgent: Okay, let me pull that up... *typing sounds* Alright, I've got the reservation here for John Smith flying Chicago to London next Thursday. As for changing the flight, since it's within a week of travel, you won't be able to change it without a penalty. However, given the circumstances you mentioned, I can file a goodwill waiver to waive the change fee just this once. Does another date work better for you?\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: Ah that's really kind of you, thanks. Umm, is there anything earlier in the week I could switch to maybe Monday or Tuesday? Don't want to risk getting sick right before the trip.\\\\n\\\\nAgent: No problem, let me check availability for those dates... *more typing* Unfortunately Monday and Tuesday are both sold out in economy. I do have two options available - one is switching to Wednesday which has seats available, or upgrading you to a Saturday departure in premium economy which would be quite a bit more expensive but might be more flexible if your health changes. What are your thoughts on those options?\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: Hmm Wednesday could work since it's not too much earlier. What would the change fee be for that date? And would I get any kind of credit since I'm having to change it last minute?\\\\n\\\\nAgent: The change fee for domestic travel is usually $200 per passenger, however since I'm waiving it as a one-time goodwill exception, there won't be any charge to change your date to Wednesday. As for a credit, unfortunately we don't offer credits for changes due to health reasons for safety and liability reasons. But I'll go ahead and switch your flight to Wednesday and send you an email confirmation of the new itinerary. Does that work for you?\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: Yeah, I understand the policy. Thank you so much for your help, I really appreciate you being able to change it for me last minute.

The booking reference is X1235467.\\\\n\\\\nAgent: Okay, let me pull up your booking. *typing sounds* Okay, I've got the booking here for Mr. Smith traveling from New York to London next Thursday. What seems to be the issue?\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: Well the thing is, something's come up and I need to change the flight. Is there any way I can move it to either the day before or the day after? \\\\n\\\\nAgent: I understand, things come up. Let me take a look at seat availability for those days. *more typing* Unfortunately both the days before and after are showing as fully booked for that route. As your booking was under 14 days, I won't be able to change the dates without a fee. Would you like me to check any other dates in the next two weeks?\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: Umm, actually I was hoping to avoid paying a change fee if possible. Is there anything you can do to help with that? \\\\n\\\\nAgent: I apologize for any inconvenience. Unfortunately with bookings this close to travel, our change policies are non-refundable. However, let me take a look see if there are any special circumstances I can apply. *types in background* It looks like we don't have any fare rules I can use to waive the fee. However, if you're open to traveling on a different route, I may be able to move your booking to a flight with open seats at no extra cost.\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: Ah okay, I was afraid you'd say that. What other routes do you have flying out around the same time? \\\\n\\\\nAgent: *checks flight schedules* It looks like we have availability on a flight from New York to Dublin that same Thursday, then you could take one of our partner airlines from Dublin to London. The flight times would be a bit later in the day but you'd avoid the change fee. Alternatively, there is space on a direct flight from New York to Manchester, which is a short train ride away from London. That flight departs earlier in the morning. Does either of those options work better for you?\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: Hmm, flying into Dublin and then taking another flight sounds like it would take longer. What time does the New York to Manchester flight leave? Maybe that would be better if it's not too early. \\\\n\\\\nAgent: The flight to Manchester departs New York at 7:15am and lands there at 10:45am. Then it's about a 1-2 hour train ride into London depending on if you get a direct service or have to change trains. Does that time work okay for you? I know it's an earlier start than flying direct but it does save you the change fee.\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: Yeah I think that'll work actually. As long as I can get back to New York from London without any issues on the return too. \\\\n\\\\nAgent: No problem, let me go ahead and switch your booking over to that New York to Manchester flight. *more typing* Okay, it's all changed - you'll be flying into Manchester instead of London on the outbound, and your return flight leaves London on the original date and time. I've sent a confirmation email with the new itinerary details to the address we have on file.

The best I may be able to offer is to credit half of the change fee back to you as future travel credit. Would that work at all?\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: *sighs* Yeah I guess that'll have to do.

Does that help put your mind at ease?\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: Yeah, that's good to hear. *sigh of relief* This winter weather has been crazy.

Is there any chance of maybe getting a better deal or any upgrades since it's gonna be a long flight for them?\\\\n\\\\nAgent: I understand, long flights can definitely be tough with little ones. Let me take a look at your reservation and see what options might be available. *more typing* So unfortunately since the flight is less than a week away, all the standard economy seats are booked up. But I do see that we have two empty seats in our Extra Legroom section. I could upgrade your family to those seats for only an additional $100 total since it's so close to departure. Would that work better for you all?\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: Yeah, $100 to get them some more space does sound worth it. Alright, go ahead and upgrade us then.

The service was absolutely terrible. \\\\n\\\\nAgent: I'm sorry to hear you had a bad experience. Can you tell me what happened on your flight?\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: So my flight from Chicago to LA was delayed by over 3 hours. No one gave us any information about what was causing the delay or when we would take off. We were just left sitting on the plane. And then when we finally did take off, we hit turbulence the whole flight. I was terrified! The flight attendants weren't any help either. \\\\n\\\\nAgent: Oh man, that does sound really frustrating. (papers shuffling in the background) Let me pull up the flight information for that route last week. Umm...it looks like there was severe weather in both Chicago and LA that caused many flights to be delayed. The pilots also reported turbulence throughout the flight. I can understand why that would be stressful for the passengers. Was there anything else that was particularly poor about the service?\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: The food was awful too. The choices were incredibly limited and it just tasted bad. And the entertainment system on my screen wasn't working for most of the flight. All I wanted to do was watch a movie to pass the time but I couldn't. The flight was miserable. \\\\n\\\\nAgent: Yeah, delayed flights are never fun and it certainly doesn't help when the food and entertainment systems aren't great either. I apologize for all the issues you experienced. (typing) Let me go ahead and document this customer complaint in your travel history. I'm not seeing any compensation offered for the delay. Would you like me to look into providing you with a travel voucher or miles for your next United trip as a courtesy for the problems?\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: A travel voucher would be appreciated. But honestly, after this experience I'm not sure I want to fly United again. Your airline really needs to improve customer service. \\\\n\\\\nAgent: I completely understand your frustration and why you may not want to fly with us again after a delay like that. Customer service is so important, and it sounds like we fell short there. I'll make sure to pass along your feedback to the appropriate teams.

Unfortunately most of our other flights are also fully booked due to high travel volumes that week. Hmm, it looks like the only option I can see that would get you into LA earlier would be to take our 7:30am flight from Chicago to Denver instead of the original 10am flight. That would get you into Denver by 9am instead of 11am. Then you'd still take the same connecting flight from Denver to LA. Does that earlier time work better for your schedule?\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: That could work, yeah. What would the cost be to change to the earlier flight? I'm trying to avoid extra fees if possible.\\\\n\\\\nAgent: I understand, we all want to avoid extra costs these days. Let me take a look at the fare difference between the flights. *types into computer again* It looks like the fare for the 7:30am flight is only about $25 more than what you've already paid for the original 10am flight. I can absolutely waive that change fee for you since the schedule change was on our end. How does that sound? Will the 7:30am flight work better for your trip next week?\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: Yeah, that works for me then. I'd like to go ahead and change to the earlier flight.\\\\n\\\\nAgent: Great, I'm happy we could find an option that works better for your trip. Let me go ahead and process that flight change for you. *types into computer* Okay, you're all set with the new itinerary. You'll be departing Chicago at 7:30am and arriving in Denver at 9am on your original travel dates. Thank you for your patience during this process.

Umm, let me pull up my confirmation...okay here it is, flight number 1234 from Chicago to Los Angeles next Wednesday. \\\\n\\\\nAgent: Okay, let me take a look at that flight for you. *typing sounds* Alright, I've got the flight pulled up. What questions did you have about it?\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: Well, ahh I was hoping to change the time of the flight. The one I'm booked on right now leaves too early, I need to try and get on a later flight that day. \\\\n\\\\nAgent: I understand, mornings can be tough when traveling. Let me check availability for later flights that day. *more typing* It looks like the only other non-stop flight we have that day leaves at 4pm. Would that work better for your schedule?\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: Hmm, 4pm would be better than the original time but is there anything even later in the day? I've got a really busy day before the flight and want to make sure I have plenty of time to get to the airport.\\\\n\\\\nAgent: You're right, having that extra time can help reduce stress. Let me check one more time...it looks like the last flight out that day is an 8:20pm departure. There are still seats available on that one if 8pm would work for your travel plans.\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: Yeah, the 8:20 flight would be perfect! Okay, let's go ahead and switch me over to that one. How do I do that? \\\\n\\\\nAgent: No problem, I'm happy we could find a better flight time for you. To change your reservation, I'll just need to collect a $75 fee per passenger since this is within 7 days of travel. Then I can process the change right away. Does that work for you?\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: Ah man, $75 is a little steep for the change. Any way you could waive that fee since I'm an loyal customer who flies with you all the time?\\\\n\\\\nAgent: I understand the fee is not ideal. Let me take a quick look at your travel history with us...It looks like you do fly United quite frequently. I'll tell you what, since you're such a good customer, I'm going to go ahead and credit you back the $75 change fee just this once. How does that sound?\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: Wow, really? That's great, thank you so much David I really appreciate you helping me out. You just made my day a lot less stressful!\\\\n\\\\nAgent: You're very welcome, it's always nice to be able to help out loyal flyers. Okay, I've just finished updating your reservation to the 8:20pm flight. You should see the change and the credited fee on your itinerary now. Please let me know if you have any other questions!\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: Nope, I think you covered everything I needed. Thanks again for all your help, have a great rest of your day!\\\\n\\\\nAgent: You too, enjoy the rest of your travels and fly safe! You have a great day as well.

The flight is currently scheduled to leave at 10am but I have a meeting that starts at 11am in LA so was hoping there was an earlier flight.\\\\n\\\\nAgent: Okay no problem, let me pull up your reservation and take a look at our flight options that day. *typing noises* Alright, it looks like the only other flight we have leaving for LA that day departs at 7:30am. Would that work better with your schedule?\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: Hmm yeah the 7:30 flight would work much better for my meeting. Is there a fee to change to that flight? \\\\n\\\\nAgent: Let me check on any fees for changing your flight. *more typing* It doesn't look like there will be a change fee since you're modifying your reservation more than 7 days before departure.

Okay, go ahead and switch me over to that flight and charge the fee to my card on file. Ah, just one other thing - how's the weather usually like in San Francisco that time of year? Trying to plan my outfit! \\\\n\\\\nAgent: Alright, I've got you updated to the 7:45am flight. You'll receive a confirmation email shortly.

It got delayed and now I'm gonna miss my connecting flight.\\\\n\\\\nAgent: I'm sorry to hear that sir, what flight were you originally supposed to take? *types on keyboard* Umm let me pull up your reservation.\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: Flight UA1488 from Chicago to Denver, it was supposed to leave at 8am but it's still not taken off yet and it's almost 10! \\\\n\\\\nAgent: Okay, let me take a look here...*more typing* Ah yes, I see the delay. There was an issue with one of the planes this morning and they had to wait for a replacement to arrive from another airport. I completely understand your frustration with missing your connection. What was your next flight?\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: It was flight UA286 from Denver to San Francisco, leaving at 11am. There's no way I'm gonna make that now. \\\\n\\\\nAgent: You're right, even if our flight left within the next 15 minutes there's no way you'd make the connection on time. Let me see what options I have for getting you out to San Fran today still. *typing rapidly* Hmm, it looks like the next nonstop isn't until 4pm. Would you be okay with a later arrival or would you like me to try to reroute you through another city?\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: Ugh, 4pm is so late. I was supposed to be in SF this afternoon for a business meeting. Can you get me there any earlier if I connect through somewhere else? This delay is really costing me.\\\\n\\\\nAgent: I understand your frustration sir, delays are never convenient. Let me pull up some alternate routes for you. *more typing and mouse clicks* Okay, it looks like if I book you through Dallas, I can get you into SFO by 2:30pm. You'd take flight UA1761 to Dallas, then UA832 from there into San Francisco. I know it's not ideal but it does get you there a few hours earlier. I'll waive the change fees since this was due to a cancellation on our end. How does that sound?\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: That's better I guess. As long as you guys are paying for this hassle. It's gonna be a long day now flying all over the place.\\\\n\\\\nAgent: I completely understand. Let me go ahead and rebook you on those flights. The good news is they both board in the next hour so you shouldn't have to wait around too long. I'm going to add a $100 flight credit to your account for the inconvenience as well. Does that sound fair?\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: Yeah, I suppose $100 is better than nothing. Thanks for helping me out Steve. I'll try not to miss my meeting now.\\\\n\\\\nAgent: You're very welcome sir, I'm glad we were able to get you rebooked. Please let me know if you have any other issues with the new itinerary. And again, I apologize for the delayed first flight. Thank you for flying with United and I hope the rest of your travels go smoothly.\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: Alright, thanks.

Would you be open to traveling tomorrow instead? I can get you on a 8am flight that will get you into LA by 11am.\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: Ugh are you serious, another full day of delays? This is unacceptable. I need to be there tonight. What about first class or an overnight flight? There has to be something.\\\\n\\\\nAgent: I understand your frustration sir, delays are never any fun. Let me take a look at upgrading you to first class or putting you on an red-eye. *typing* It looks like first class is also fully booked on the remaining flights today. However, I do have one seat left in business class on a United red-eye leaving Chicago at 10pm and arriving in LA at 6am. I can upgrade you to that for $250. Will that work?\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: *sighs loudly* I really didn't want to have to spend the night in the airport and on another plane but I guess I don't have a choice at this point. Okay yeah go ahead and switch me to that. And can you please reimburse me for the difference in fare? This has just been a huge hassle.\\\\n\\\\nAgent: Absolutely, I completely understand. Thanks for your flexibility - I'm happy we could get you booked on that later flight. As for the difference in fare, as a one-time gesture due to the multiple delays let me go ahead and provide you with a $200 flight credit that you can use for future travel.

Let me see what other options might be available. *types into computer* Hmm, given the amount you paid for the ticket and the financial impact the delay caused, I think in this situation a full refund is certainly justified. I've processed a full refund of the $528 ticket back to your original form of payment. Does issuing the full refund help resolve this situation better for you?\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: Wow, a full refund? Yes, that does make me feel a lot better, thank you. I really appreciate you going above and beyond on that. It still doesn't make up for losing the client, but it's better than nothing.

Umm, let me pull up my confirmation email...(pause) okay, so I was supposed to fly from Chicago to LA last Thursday but my flight got delayed by over 3 hours. \\\\n\\\\nAgent: I'm sorry to hear about that delay, delays are never fun. Can you confirm the flight number for me?\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: Yeah, it was flight 1982. We were originally supposed to take off at 2pm but we didn't get in the air until after 5! I missed an important meeting because of it.\\\\n\\\\nAgent: Okay, let me pull up the details for flight 1982 last Thursday. *typing sounds* Hmm, it looks like that flight did experience a significant delay due to weather issues in Chicago. There was a storm that rolled through and caused delays across the board. I apologize for the missed connection and any inconvenience the delay caused. How can I assist you further regarding this issue?\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: Well it's just really frustrating you know? I bought these tickets months ago and cleared my schedule for that day based on the flight times. Now I've lost business because of y'all's delay. Is there any kind of compensation you can offer me for this?\\\\n\\\\nAgent: I completely understand your frustration, sir. Delays are never ideal especially when you've planned around the scheduled flight times. Let me take a look at your ticket information and booking details to see if there are any options as far as compensation. Hmm, it looks like you purchased a non-refundable economy ticket. Unfortunately in the case of weather delays, our policy is that we cannot provide monetary compensation for issues outside of the airline's control. However, I'd be happy to look into other arrangements such as a goodwill gesture like travel vouchers or miles to help make up for the delay. Would something like that be helpful?\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: Travel vouchers aren't going to get that meeting back on my calendar. I need some actual money back here, this cost me way more than what I paid for the stupid ticket. You guys messed up my schedule, the least you can do is refund me.\\\\n\\\\nAgent: I apologize but I'm unable to provide a full monetary refund for this non-refundable ticket. However, as a one-time courtesy, I can credit your account $150 that can be applied to future United travel within the next 12 months. Will that work for you in this situation? I'm afraid it's the best I can offer under our policies.\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: Ugh fine, I guess $150 is better than nothing. This better not happen again next time I fly y'all's crappy airline. \\\\n\\\\nAgent: I understand your frustration and appreciate your business. Thank you for your time today and I hope the travel credit helps make up for some of the inconvenience. Please don't hesitate to reach back out if you have any other issues or concerns. You have a great rest of your day.\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: Yeah, thanks. *call disconnects*\\\\n\\\\nAgent: Thank you for calling United Airlines, have a good one. *call concludes*\", 60.0, 480.0, 153460, \"neutral\", \"frustrated\", -0.07, 0.09, \"Voluntary   Change\", \"Charles Hurst\", 1.0], [5678060132, 6206117807, 878048, \"2024-08-01 08:41:00\", \"2024-08-01 08:46:00\", \"2024-08-01 09:23:00\", \"\\\\n\\\\nAgent: Thank you for calling United Airlines, this is David speaking.

I was wondering what's going on with that flight?\\\\n\\\\nAgent: No problem, let me pull up your flight information. *typing sounds* Okay, it looks like that flight is currently delayed 2 hours due to maintenance issues with the aircraft. Umm, the maintenance crew is working to get the plane ready for takeoff as soon as possible, but it may be another hour or so before they have an updated estimated departure time. I apologize for the delay.\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: Ah man, 2 hours? That really throws a wrench in my plans. Is there any way I can get on an earlier flight maybe? \\\\n\\\\nAgent: Let me check on other flight options for you. *more typing* It looks like we do have some open seats on a flight leaving in about an hour that would get you into New York around the same time. I can get you switched over to that one if you like? The only thing is it would require stopping in Chicago first before the connection to New York.\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: Hmm, having to stop in Chicago first isn't ideal but I guess it's better than waiting around for 2 hours. Okay, yeah go ahead and switch me to that earlier flight then please. \\\\n\\\\nAgent: No problem, I appreciate your flexibility.

What change would you like to make to the flight?\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: Well the thing is, my meeting in LA got postponed until next week so I need to change the date. But when I tried doing it online the new dates were all way more expensive. What are my options?\\\\n\\\\nAgent: Let me take a look at your reservation and see what I can do for you. What's the last name the ticket is under?\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: Jackson. John Jackson.\\\\n\\\\nAgent: Okay, let me pull that up... *typing noises* Alright, I have your reservation here Mr. Jackson. You're correct that our prices have gone up for the new dates you'll need. However, since this is a schedule change initiated by you and not due to our cancellation, the difference in fare would need to be paid. Let me check one thing though... Ah yes, it looks like we do have seats available on the same flight next Wednesday that would only be a $100 change fee. Would that work better for your schedule?\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: Ugh a $100 fee? That's still a lot. Is there any way you could waive that or give me a credit or something since I'm changing it cause of their delay?\\\\n\\\\nAgent: I understand the fee is still significant. Unfortunately with the short notice and high demand for those dates, our waiver policy doesn't allow me to bypass the change fee. However, let me see if there's anything else I can offer. *typing sounds* It seems like you're a frequent flyer with us, with Gold status. In recognition of your loyalty to United, I'd be happy to credit your account with a $50 voucher that could be used for future travel. Does that help at all?\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: *long sigh* Yeah I suppose $50 is better than nothing. Alright, go ahead and change my flight to next Wednesday then. This better flight not get delayed too!\\\\n\\\\nAgent: I've processed the change for you sir. Your new flight information for next Wednesday will be sent to the email on file. And don't worry, I'll put a special note on your reservation asking our operation teams to please do everything they can to avoid any delays.

Let me check availability for earlier flights on Tuesday. *typing sounds* Unfortunately the only other nonstop flight that day leaves at 7am, would that work for your schedule?\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: 7am might be pushing it honestly. Is there anything on Monday I could switch to instead? I'd really rather not have to spend an extra night in San Francisco if I don't have to.\\\\n\\\\nAgent: Yeah no problem, let me check Monday flights for you. Hmm, it looks like we have some good options on Monday. How does a noon departure work for you? That would get you into San Francisco by 2:30pm.\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: That could work, what's the fare difference if I change to Monday? The meeting getting moved is really throwing a wrench in my plans. \\\\n\\\\nAgent: I understand the frustration. Let me take a look at the fare rules for your current ticket. *more typing* It looks like since this is a schedule change within 14 days of departure, there will be a $100 fee per ticket to change to the Monday flight. Does that work for your budget?\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: Ugh, $100 just to change the day? That's ridiculous. Is there any way you could waive that fee since this is out of my control? I'm already paying almost $500 for the flight.\\\\n\\\\nAgent: I apologize for the inconvenience sir. Unfortunately with it being so close to departure our change fees are non-waivable. I can certainly understand the frustration with the last minute meeting change throwing a wrench in your plans. Let me see if there are any other flight options I can try to offer you as an alternative. *more typing* Would flying out Sunday afternoon instead of Monday be doable? There is a 3pm departure with no change fee.\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: Sunday could work I guess, what time does that flight get into SFO? \\\\n\\\\nAgent: The Sunday flight is scheduled to land at SFO at 5:30pm. Does that timing work better for your trip? I know it's still an adjustment but it would save you the change fee.\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: You know, the timing actually does work better for the meeting schedule they gave me on Wednesday. Alright, let's switch me over to that Sunday flight then. I really appreciate you working with me on this.\\\\n\\\\nAgent: No problem at all, I'm happy we could find an option to fit your schedule without additional costs. One moment while I process this change for you. *typing and clicking sounds* Okay Mr. Myers, you are all set on the 3pm flight to San Francisco this Sunday.

It was a complete disaster from start to finish. \\\\n\\\\nAgent: I'm sorry to hear you had a bad experience. Could you please provide me with your confirmation number so I can look up your flight details?\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: Ugh, hold on let me find the stupid paper...okay it's BG348921. \\\\n\\\\nAgent: Okay, let me pull that up...alright I see your flight from Chicago to Denver last Saturday. What seems to have gone wrong?\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: Where do I even start! First of all, our flight was delayed for over 3 hours with no explanation given. We just sat on the tarmac forever. Then when we finally took off, the cabin was boiling hot the whole time. I saw at least 3 flight attendants on their phones the whole flight, ignoring passengers that needed help. And if that wasn't bad enough, my bag was one of the many that got lost! It's been 4 days and I still haven't gotten it back. This was honestly the worst travel experience of my life.\\\\n\\\\nAgent: I understand your frustration, sir. Flight delays are never acceptable and it seems there were multiple issues that made your journey very unpleasant. Let me take a closer look at what happened. *types for a few moments* It looks like there was severe weather in Chicago that day which caused many delays across the board. As for the temperature issues, it seems the air conditioning system was not functioning properly on that aircraft. I'm truly sorry you had to endure that. In regards to your missing bag, I see it was misrouted and is currently at our Denver location. I'll make sure to expedite getting that delivered to you today. Do you have a current address I can confirm?\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: Ugh, yeah the weather figures. But three hours?! Come on. And the flight attendants, that's just unacceptable. As for my address, it's 123 Main St, Denver, CO 80204. This better not take any longer to get to me. \\\\n\\\\nAgent: You're right, three hours is a long delay and the cabin environment and customer service on board should have been better handled. I'm making a note of the issues you reported so we can work on improving that experience. And don't worry, I'll contact our Denver baggage team right now and instruct them to deliver your bag within the next few hours. Is there anything else I can do for you today to help make this right? Perhaps a travel voucher for future flights?\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: Hmm...a voucher would be a start I guess. But honestly, this really left a bad taste in my mouth about United. I've been a loyal customer for years but after this fiasco I'm not sure I want to fly with you guys anymore. There needs to be some real changes if you want repeat customers. \\\\n\\\\nAgent: You've been a loyal customer and I completely understand why this experience has diminished your confidence in us. Let me issue you a $300 travel voucher that's valid for one year as a gesture of goodwill. And I can assure you that customer feedback like yours is so valuable - it really does help us identify areas for improvement. If there's any other way I can try to restore your trust in United, please let me know. Otherwise, I hope this voucher helps make your next travel plans a bit less stressful. Thank you for taking the time to share your experience - it will go a long way in enhancing service going forward.\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: You know, I appreciate you hearing me out and doing what you can to help. $300 is better than nothing I guess.

Let me check one more time...*lots of clicking* it doesn't look like we have any seats left on any flights from New York to Seattle for this Wednesday. I'm really sorry about that. The best I can offer is a partial refund since it's within 24 hours of your original travel date and try to rebook for another time. I know it's not the solution you were hoping for.\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: This is ridiculous.

You'll receive a confirmation email shortly. Thank you for flying with us and I hope you have a better experience on your next trip. Please let me know if there's anything else I can assist with today.\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: Yeah hopefully my flight at least goes smoothly since I'm paying so much to change it. Alright well thanks I think that's it. Have a good one.\\\\n\\\\nAgent: You're very welcome, and I hope you have a good rest of your day.

I'm getting really worried about it.\\\\n\\\\nAgent: No problem sir, what seems to be the issue with your flight? *background office noise*\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: Well the thing is my flight keeps getting delayed. It was supposed to leave at 6pm last Thursday but got pushed back to 8pm and then 9pm. And now I check the app again and it says it's at 11pm. I have an important meeting early next morning that I really can't miss. \\\\n\\\\nAgent: I understand your frustration sir. Delays are never fun especially when you have commitments. Let me take a look at your flight details. *typing sounds* Okay, it looks like there has been some weather issues at O'Hare airport causing backups. What day is your current flight scheduled for?\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: It's this coming Wednesday. But the weather forecast is showing more rain and storms then too. I'm worried it'll get delayed and mess up my plans. Is there any way I can get on an earlier flight maybe Monday instead? Even if it means paying more? I really need to be in Chicago for that meeting.\\\\n\\\\nAgent: Hmm I see...let me check our flight options for Monday. *more typing* Unfortunately all the flights on Monday are booked up already. The next available flight I see is Tuesday morning at 7am. I can upgrade you to that flight but it will be an additional $150 given it's such short notice. How does that sound? I know it's not ideal having to leave even earlier but at least it gets you there a full day sooner. \\\\n\\\\nCustomer: Ugh $150 is kinda steep but I guess it's better than missing my meeting. Alright go ahead and switch me to that Tuesday morning flight then. Can you just make sure I'm on the actual plane this time and it doesn't get delayed! \\\\n\\\\nAgent: I really appreciate your understanding. Let me process that flight change for you now. *clicking sounds* Okay sir you're all set with the Tuesday 7am flight. As for delays, unfortunately there's no guarantees with Mother Nature but I'll put a note on your reservation for flight crew to prioritize getting you out on time. Please let me know if there's anything else I can help with!\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: Thanks I guess that will have to do. Alright well I better get going, got some packing to do now leaving a day early.

Can I get your last name and confirmation number please?\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: Yeah it's Smith, confirmation number is BK47392. *sighs* I'm sorry, I'm just really stressed about missing this family thing.\\\\n\\\\nAgent: No worries, I understand. Let me take a look here...okay Mr. Smith, I see your flight. What day did you need to change your return to?\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: Friday instead of Saturday. Is there any way to do that without paying a change fee? This is really last minute so I wasn't expecting there to be any seats left but it would be great if I didn't have to pay. \\\\n\\\\nAgent: Hmm, let me check availability for Friday. *typing sounds* Unfortunately it looks like that flight is full up. The next available flight returning on Friday would be in the late evening. In terms of change fees, since this is within 7 days of travel I wouldn't be able to waive the fee. The charge to switch your flight would be $200. Does that work for you or would you like me to explore some other options?\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: Ugh $200? That's ridiculous, it's not even my fault I have to change it. Is there any way you can make an exception just this once? I'm a very loyal customer and fly with you all the time. \\\\n\\\\nAgent: I understand the frustration, sir, but unfortunately with it being so close to travel our change policies are non-negotiable. Let me take a look at some other options for you - would you consider traveling a day earlier to Thursday instead? I see there are a few seats left on that outbound flight that I could switch you to at no additional cost.\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: Thursday? *long sigh* I guess that would have to work. It's not ideal but at least it's better than paying $200. Alright, let's do that then. Thursday it is. \\\\n\\\\nAgent: Okay great, I'm going to go ahead and process that change for you. It may take a few minutes to update the reservation. While I work on that, is there anything else I can help with today?\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: No, I think that covers it.

Sorry for being kind of annoyed before, it's just been a really stressful week. \\\\n\\\\nAgent: No problem at all, I completely understand. Travel snafus are never fun.

This whole thing has really ruined my weekend plans. \\\\n\\\\nAgent: Thanks, let me pull up your flight information...okay it looks like there was severe weather in Chicago that caused many flights to be delayed that day. I'm afraid weather is outside of our control. As for the cabin shaking, was the flight attendants made aware during the flight? That doesn't sound normal.\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: No, I didn't say anything to the flight attendants. I just wanted to get off that death trap as soon as possible. This is unacceptable service for the price we paid. Your airline needs to do better.\\\\n\\\\nAgent: You're right, we aim to provide a comfortable and reliable travel experience. Even with weather delays, I understand how disruptive it was to your plans. Let me take a look at some options to make this up to you... Ah yes, it looks like we can offer you a $500 travel voucher that is valid for your next United ticket within the next year. How does that sound as a gesture of goodwill? \\\\n\\\\nCustomer: *sighs* I suppose $500 is better than nothing. This really left a bad taste in my mouth about flying United though. You guys have lost my loyalty as a frequent flyer.\\\\n\\\\nAgent: I completely understand your frustration and thank you for your past business. Perhaps the voucher will encourage you to give us another try down the road. Please also feel free to reach back out if you have any other travel issues come up. We're always working to improve.

The good news is we do have some earlier flights available that day if you wanted to change to one of those. What time do you need to arrive in LA by?\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: Ugh, what a pain. I was worried about weather delays. Unfortunately I need to be in LA by about 5pm for a meeting, so even a 2 hour delay probably won't work. Do you have any flights before noon maybe?\\\\n\\\\nAgent: Hmm, let me check. *more typing* It looks like we have a flight leaving at 10:15am that would get you into LAX at 1:15pm. Would that work timing-wise? The only thing is that flight is starting to get full so I'd need to get you booked on it right away if you want to switch to that one.\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: Yeah, that 10:15 flight sounds perfect actually. Can you switch me over to that one? I'm just so over flying lately with all the delays and cancellations, I'd rather be early than risk being really late, you know? \\\\n\\\\nAgent: Absolutely, I completely understand. No problem at all, let me go ahead and process that change for you. The good news is since this is a schedule change on our end, there won't be any additional fees for switching flights.

Have you received any notifications about any changes?\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: No, I haven't received anything. I just wanted to double check before I finalize some plans for when I land. You know, with all the delays and cancellations lately I just wanted to be sure.\\\\n\\\\nAgent: No I completely understand, it's always a good idea to confirm as closer to the travel date. The schedule for that flight is holding steady at the moment. Is there anything else I can check for you while we're on the call?\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: Well, actually I had one other question. With all the issues they've been having, if the flight does get delayed or cancelled, what are my options for rebooking or getting a refund?\\\\n\\\\nAgent: Okay, let me go over United's policies in case of delays or cancellations. If your flight is cancelled, we will rebook you on the next available flight to your destination at no additional cost to you. In most cases, we aim to get passengers rebooked within a few hours of the original flight time. As for delays, if your flight is delayed over 3 hours, you are eligible for a full refund if you choose not to travel. We will also provide meal vouchers and hotel accommodations if an overnight stay is required due to lengthy delays. Does that help explain your options?\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: Yeah, that's helpful to know. I'm just a little nervous about travel delays throwing a wrench in my plans. Is there any way I could get bumped up to an earlier flight, just in case? I'd be willing to pay the difference.\\\\n\\\\nAgent: Let me see what options there are to get you on an earlier flight. *typing sounds* It looks like we do have some empty seats on an flight that departs Newark at 8am instead of 10am. The fare difference to upgrade would be an additional $75 per ticket. Would you like me to go ahead and switch you over to that earlier flight? That way if anything does cause delays, you have a bit of a buffer.\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: Yeah, I think that's a good idea just to be safe. Go ahead and switch me over to the 8am flight and charge the $75 to my card on file.\\\\n\\\\nAgent: Okay, I've got you all switched over to the 8am flight. You should see the updated confirmation email shortly. And don't worry, even with the schedule change, your original booking is fully protected and non-refundable now. Is there anything else I can help with today?\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: No, I think that covers everything. Thanks so much for your help, Sam! I appreciate you taking the time to address all my questions and concerns.\\\\n\\\\nAgent: You're very welcome! I'm glad I could help provide some reassurance about your travel plans.

I also wanted to double check if I can still make seat assignments at the airport or if I need to do that online before my trip.\\\\n\\\\nAgent: For that flight, you'll want to select your seats ahead of time online or through the United mobile app. At the airport kiosks they typically only handle standby and same-day changes.

The good news is we were able to get you on the exact same flight times, just a later date. Your new confirmation number is GTH4598R. I'm sorry for the confusion and change, those maintenance issues are always unpredictable. \\\\n\\\\nCustomer: Ugh, great. Two weeks later? That really screws things up for me. Is there any way I can get on an earlier flight?\\\\n\\\\nAgent: I understand the change is inconvenient. Let me take a look at other flight options for you. *more typing sounds* Hmm, it looks pretty booked up between now and your original travel date. The closest I can get you is 5 days later. I can rebook you on our flight leaving Chicago on the 15th, arriving in Paris on the 16th. Would that work better for your travel plans?\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: I guess 5 days is better than 2 weeks. Alright, go ahead and switch me to that flight then. But I better not have any other issues! \\\\n\\\\nAgent: Absolutely, I'll make sure to get you on solid confirmation for that flight. *typing* Okay, it's all set. Your new confirmation number is DGX7413T. Please let me know if you have any other problems between now and your travel date. As an apology for the inconvenience, I've also added a $100 travel voucher to your account to put towards food or luggage fees on your trip. Thank you so much for your patience today and I hope you have a wonderful time in Paris!\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: Ugh, fine. Thanks I guess. This still sucks but whatever. \\\\n\\\\nAgent: I completely understand your frustration. Travel issues are never fun to deal with. I'm glad we could get it rescheduled sooner though.

How does that sound?\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: Are you kidding me? That's way too late, I have an important meeting first thing tomorrow morning that I need to be there for. Don't you have anything earlier?\\\\n\\\\nAgent: I apologize for the inconvenience sir, weather delays are certainly out of our control. *pause* Let me check a few other airports just in case. *more typing* It looks like we have a flight with a connection in Phoenix that would get you into LA around 3pm. Would that work better for your schedule? I know it isn't nonstop but it does get you there a few hours earlier.\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: 3pm is still really late. This is unacceptable, between the massive delay last night and not having any decent flight options, you guys are really dropping the ball here. Is there any way you can get me on an earlier flight even if it means flying a different airline? You owe me for all these delays.\\\\n\\\\nAgent: I understand your frustration sir. Let me see if there is anything I can do like getting you on another airline. *typing noises* It looks like American has a direct flight leaving in an hour that would get you into LA at 2pm. Would you like me to book you on that flight instead? I'll go ahead and refund your original United ticket as well as provide a $200 flight credit for your next United trip due to the delays.\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: Finally, some progress. Yes, please book me on that American flight right away. And I better be compensated for this nightmare of a travel day. $200 is nothing for the hassle you guys put me through. \\\\n\\\\nAgent: Okay sir, I'm going to book you now on the 1pm American flight and refund your original United ticket.

Can you tell me about your experience on that flight?\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: It was a nightmare. First, my flight was delayed by 3 hours with no explanation. Then when I finally board the plane, I find out they had overbooked and I didn't have a seat! I had to sit between two large men in the very back with no room to move. \\\\n\\\\nAgent: Oh wow, that does sound extremely unpleasant. *typing noise* Let me pull up the details of your flight. What was the date of travel?\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: Last Tuesday. Flight number was United 2121. The whole experience has really soured me on United. This is not how you treat customers who have flown with you for 10 years!\\\\n\\\\nAgent: I completely understand your frustration. Just one second while I review the notes on that flight...Okay, it looks like there was severe weather along that route which caused many flights to be delayed. As for the seating issue, we do seem to have oversold that flight. I sincerely apologize for the poor experience. *pause* How can I make this right for you?\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: I want a full refund for that ticket. And I want United credit for two business class tickets on my next flight so I don't have to deal with being crammed in back again. If I don't get that, I'll be taking my business to another airline from now on. \\\\n\\\\nAgent: You know, I can understand why you feel that way. Being stuck in the back like that after a long delay is unacceptable. *typing* Let me go ahead and process that full ticket refund for you. And I'll add $1200 in United flight credits to your account for future travel. Will that work for you?\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: *sigh of relief* I guess that will have to do. But you better believe I'll be tweeting about this experience too so others know how poorly United treats its customers. \\\\n\\\\nAgent: I completely understand, sir. Please feel free to share your feedback - it's the only way we'll improve. And know that I'm personally apologizing for the poor service.

What seems to be the issue with your flight?\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: Well ahh, I was hoping to change the time of the flight. The original flight was scheduled to leave at 10am but I have a meeting that got moved to 11am so I was wondering if there was an option later in the day.\\\\n\\\\nAgent: No problem, let me pull up your reservation and take a look at our flight options for that route on Friday. *types on computer* Okay, it looks like the only other nonstop flight that day leaves at 3pm. We do have some connecting flight options that would get you into Denver around 1pm or 2pm if that works better with your schedule.\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: Hmm the 3pm flight might cutting it too close since my meeting ends at noon. What are the connecting flight options and how long would the layovers be? Also what would the cost be to change to one of those? My original ticket was nonrefundable.\\\\n\\\\nAgent: I understand the timing concern. Let me give you the details on the connecting flights. The first option has a departure from Chicago at 8am with a 50 minute layover in Denver before getting into Denver at 12:50pm. The second option is a 7am departure from Chicago with a 1 hour and 20 minute layover in Dallas before arriving in Denver at 1:15pm. Both of those should get you there with plenty of time after your meeting. As for the cost, since your original ticket was nonrefundable there would be a $100 change fee per passenger plus any difference in fare. The fare for the 8am option is about $25 more and the 7am option is $50 more than your original ticket. Does either of those work better for your schedule?\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: Umm yeah let me think about this for a second. *pause* I think I'll go with the 8am flight with the short layover in Denver. That $25 fee is better than missing my meeting. Can you go ahead and make that change for me? \\\\n\\\\nAgent: No problem, I'm happy I could find an option that works better for your schedule. Let me go ahead and process that flight change for you. *typing sounds* Okay, it's all set. You'll be flying from Chicago to Denver on that 8am flight next Friday with a 50 minute layover.

The weather here has been terrible.\\\\n\\\\nAgent: I understand your concern sir. Let me take a look at the forecast and your itinerary. *typing noises* It looks like the weather is expected to clear up overnight so I wouldn't expect any cancellations. However, there is a chance of minor delays tomorrow morning as they work to clear the runways. What time is your flight scheduled to depart?\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: It leaves at 8am.

And it's not like I can change my flight either since everything else is booked. \\\\n\\\\nAgent: I understand your frustration sir, delayed or canceled flights are never ideal. United strives for on-time performance but Mother Nature doesn't always cooperate. I apologize for any past issues you've experienced.

However, given the likelihood of delays, I'd be happy to credit your account with a travel voucher for $100 that you can use on a future United purchase. Does that seem fair to help make up for the inconvenience?\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: Ah man, I was hoping for an actual upgrade but I guess $100 is better than nothing. Alright, yeah go ahead and add that voucher to my account then. Thanks...I think. Umm, do you have an arrival time estimate if there are delays? I need to know how late I should reschedule my meeting.\\\\n\\\\nAgent: Let me check the average arrival times from O'Hare when there have been delays. *typing* Based on previous days when departures were delayed 1-2 hours, arrivals into LAX have typically been 1-3 hours behind schedule. So I would tentatively plan your meeting for no earlier than 3pm just to be safe. And of course, I'll call you first thing in the morning with the latest estimated departure and any potential arrival time changes.

Your website said the flight time was supposed to be 5 hours and it ended up taking me over 9 hours to get there. That's unacceptable. \\\\n\\\\nAgent: You're right, that is an excessive delay. Let me take a look at our refund and rebooking policies for flights impacted by weather. *typing sounds* Okay, unfortunately since the delay was due to severe thunderstorms which are considered an \\\"act of God\\\" outside of our control, our policy is not to provide cash refunds. However, I'd be happy to book you on another airline at no additional cost, or provide you with a travel voucher for 120% of the original ticket price that's valid for one year. Does either of those options work for you?\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: A voucher? Are you kidding me? I paid you almost a thousand dollars including baggage fees and you're giving me a stupid voucher? No way, I want my money back. This is ridiculous, I'll never fly United again. \\\\n\\\\nAgent: I understand your frustration sir, and I'm sorry that a refund isn't allowed per our policy. Perhaps we could meet halfway - would you accept a 150% travel voucher and 500 United miles as a goodwill gesture? I know it's not ideal, but it would allow you to book future travel at no cost. Umm, and I'll be sure to note your record that you had a negative experience so we can try to avoid issues next time. What do you think, is that fair compensation?\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: *sighs loudly* I guess that will have to do then. But I better be able to use that voucher for any flight I want, even international ones. And you guys need to get your act together with these delays. \\\\n\\\\nAgent: Absolutely, the voucher will be valid for up to $900 to book any United or United Express flight, domestic or international. And you're right, we definitely need to work on improving on-time performance.

Is that something I can do?\\\\n\\\\nAgent: Let me take a look and see what options are available for changing your date. *more typing* It looks like we do have seats available on the flight two days earlier. It would be a $150 change fee to move your reservation. How does that sound?\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: Hmm, $150 fee is a bit more than I was hoping for. Would there be any way to waive the fee or reduce it at all? Money is a little tight right now after this unexpected change of plans.\\\\n\\\\nAgent: I understand, last minute changes can definitely impact your budget. Let me check if there are any promotions or exceptions I can apply for you. *typing again* It doesn't look like I have any promotions available on your route to lower the fee. However, as a one-time courtesy since you've been a loyal customer, I can reduce the fee to $100 instead of the full $150. Does that work a little better for your situation?\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: Yeah, you know what Claire, I think I can make that $100 fee work. This change is really important for me to make. Thank you so much for your help and for reducing the fee, I really appreciate it.\\\\n\\\\nAgent: You're very welcome, I'm glad I could help get you on that earlier flight. I'll go ahead and process the change of date on your reservation now. It may take a few minutes to fully update in the system. Thank you for being understanding about our policies. I hope you have a good rest of your day and a smooth flight!\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: Thanks so much Claire, you too. Enjoy the rest of your day as well. Goodbye!\\\\n\\\\nAgent: You're welcome!

I wanted to double check something on my booking.\\\\n\\\\nAgent: No problem, what would you like to check about your booking?\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: Ahh okay so like my flight is scheduled to leave at 8am but I need to push it back a couple hours if possible. Would there maybe be any later flights available that day?\\\\n\\\\nAgent: Let me pull up your reservation and take a look at our flight options for that route on that day. *typing noises* Okay, I've got your booking pulled up. What time were you hoping to depart instead of the 8am flight?\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: Umm, is there anything around 11 or noon maybe? I just found out I have a meeting in the morning that got pushed back so the early flight won't work for me now.\\\\n\\\\nAgent: I understand, last minute changes can be frustrating. Let me see what we have...it looks like the next flight departing for Chicago after your 8am is at 12:15pm. We would have to change you to that flight and charge you the difference in fare. The good news is that flight is not full yet so we should be able to get you on it no problem. How does that sound?\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: Ah yeah that 12:15 flight works much better for me. How much more is that going to cost do you know? Money is a bit tight these days, ya know? \\\\n\\\\nAgent: *typing noises* Okay, it looks like the difference in fare between the 8am flight and the 12:15pm flight is an additional $75 plus taxes and fees. Does that work for your budget or would you like me to check on any other date options that may be cheaper? I know last minute changes aren't ideal financially.\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: Man, $75 is pretty steep just for a few hours difference. Let me think for a minute...is there any chance maybe I could get like a credit or something since this is kinda United's fault for changing my meeting? I'm kind of a loyal customer and fly with you guys a lot.\\\\n\\\\nAgent: I understand the frustration with the last minute cost. Unfortunately we don't have any promotions I could apply to lower the change fee in this situation. However, as a loyal customer who flies with us frequently, I'd be happy to submit a goodwill request on your behalf to our customer relations team asking them to consider issuing a $50 credit to your United account. I can't guarantee they will approve it, but it doesn't hurt to ask and it may help offset some of the cost. Does that sound okay as an option?\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: Yeah you know what, I'll take that option. At least it's something and it was nice of you to offer to submit the request. Thanks for your help Sarah, I really appreciate you working with me on this.\\\\n\\\\nAgent: You're very welcome, I'm glad we were able to find a solution. Thank you for being so understanding. I'll go ahead and process the flight change for you now and submit that goodwill request.

Is that something I can do?\\\\n\\\\nAgent: No problem, let me take a look at your reservation. What's the name the flight is booked under?\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: It's under Jacob Smith.\\\\n\\\\nAgent: Okay, let me pull that up... *typing noises* Alright, I've got your reservation here Jacob. What time is your current flight leaving on Wednesday?\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: It's scheduled to depart at 10am. \\\\n\\\\nAgent: Okay, and what time would you like to change it to?\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: If possible, I'd like to take an earlier flight. Is there anything around 7 or 8am?\\\\n\\\\nAgent: Let me check availability for those times... *more typing* It looks like we have one leaving at 7:15am that would get you into LA a couple hours earlier. The good news is that flight isn't full yet so I can get you switched over no problem. The only thing is it will be a $50 change fee since it's within 7 days of your travel date. Does that work for you?\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: Hmm, $50 is a bit more than I was hoping to pay. Are there any other options maybe later in the day? I know my schedule has been a bit up in the air.\\\\n\\\\nAgent: Umm, let me look at some other times... *typing continues* It seems like the next available flight after your original 10am departure is at 3:45pm. That one would have no change fee since it's more than 2 hours later than your current reservation. However, it would mean losing most of your day in LA. Does that one work better for you even with the late arrival? Otherwise I can keep looking at other dates if you want to move your travel plans.\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: Ah man, losing most of the day isn't ideal either. Let me think about it for a minute... is there any way we could work with the $50 change fee to get me on that earlier 7:15am flight? Money is a bit tight but that extra time would be really helpful.\\\\n\\\\nAgent: I understand, travel budgets can be tricky. Let me see if there's anything I can do on my end to help. *puts call on brief hold* Just spoke to my supervisor - we have a limited number of fee waivers I can offer to valued customers. Would you be okay with a $25 change fee instead to get you on that 7:15am flight? I'm afraid that's the best I can do.\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: You know, $25 is really reasonable given the convenience. I appreciate you going above and beyond to help me out. Let's go ahead and switch me over to that morning flight.\\\\n\\\\nAgent: Wonderful, I'm happy we could work something out. Just need to read back the new itinerary details to you for confirmation. Your new flight will depart Chicago O'Hare on Wednesday, March 15th at 7:15am and will arrive at Los Angeles International at 9:53am. The flight number is UA1245 and it will be operated on a Boeing 737. Please allow me a moment to process the change on my end and you will receive a confirmation email shortly.

What time is your current flight scheduled to depart?\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: It's at 10am.

The next flight with availability after that doesn't leave until 6pm. Would that later time work for you instead?\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: Ah shoot, I was really hoping for the 2pm one. What are the chances someone could cancel between now and then, do you think? \\\\n\\\\nAgent: It's possible someone may cancel their reservation closer to the date. The flight isn't quite full yet so there should still be a few empty seats. I can put a note on your reservation and try to get you upgraded if a seat opens up in the 2pm flight. I can't guarantee it of course but it's worth a try. Would you like me to do that?\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: Yeah, let's go ahead and do that. What do I need to do if a seat does become available?\\\\n\\\\nAgent: Okay, I've added a request to be notified about any upgrades. If a seat opens up in the 2pm flight, we'll call or email you to let you know. From there, you can just call us back to switch your reservation over to the new flight time.

When I try to check the status on the website it just says the flight information is unavailable. I've been on hold for over an hour trying to get through to someone. This is ridiculous. \\\\n\\\\nAgent: I apologize for the long hold time and the issues with your flight. Let me take a look at that booking for you. *typing noises* Okay, it looks like your New York to LA flight for next Thursday was unfortunately canceled due to maintenance issues with the aircraft. The good news is we were able to move you to an alternate flight leaving an hour later at no additional cost. Does that work for your travel plans?\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: An hour later?! Ugh, that totally throws off my schedule for the day. I was supposed to have a meeting at noon when I landed. Now I won't get in until 1. This is so frustrating. Is there any earlier flight I could take instead?\\\\n\\\\nAgent: I completely understand your frustration with the change. Let me see if there are any other flight options that depart earlier. *more typing* Unfortunately the next earliest flight is about 3 hours earlier but it would require a connection in Chicago which may be too tight of a layover. I'm really sorry about this. Would you like me to book you on that earlier connecting flight or stay with the nonstop one hour later departure? I can also look into other airline options if you need to arrive in LA earlier.\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: Ugh, I really don't want to have to mess with a connection. It sounds like I'd be cutting it too close. Is there any chance of an earlier nonstop? Money is no object at this point, I just need to get there on time.\\\\n\\\\nAgent: Let me check one more time to see if any nonstop flights opened up earlier. *typing for over a minute* It looks like we do have one seat available on an nonstop flight that departs New York two hours earlier. It would be at a higher flexible fare but would allow you to make your noon meeting. Would you like me to book you on that flight instead? I'll waive the change fee since this was due to a cancellation on our end.\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: Yes, please go ahead and switch me to the earlier flight. I'm sorry for getting frustrated, this has just been such a pain to deal with. I appreciate you working with me to find a solution though.\\\\n\\\\nAgent: No problem at all, I completely understand. Thank you for your patience and for flying with us. Okay, I've gone ahead and updated your booking to the two hours earlier nonstop flight. You'll receive an email confirmation shortly. Please let me know if you have any other questions! I'm hoping this gets you to LA in time for your meeting.\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: Okay, thank you so much for your help. I think that takes care of everything.

Yes, you're right, flight 456 from Chicago had major delays due to weather and ended up arriving in Denver over 5 hours late. I can understand why that caused you to miss your connecting flight. One moment while I take a look at our policies for delayed flights...\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: *sighs* yeah, it was just really annoying because I had this big presentation for a new client and it totally threw me off. And of course they weren't very understanding about it. \\\\n\\\\nAgent: I completely understand your frustration, missing a flight can really throw a wrench in your plans. Let me see here...okay, since the delay was due to weather and outside of our control, unfortunately we won't be able to provide you with a full refund. However, given the length of the delay and that you missed your connection, I think we can offer you a $300 travel voucher to put towards future travel. Does that sound fair to help make up for the hassle?\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: Ah man, really? A voucher isn't super helpful if I don't have any other trips planned yet. And $300 doesn't really cover what I lost with that client. Can you do anything else? \\\\n\\\\nAgent: You're right, I understand a voucher isn't very useful if you don't have upcoming travel plans. Let me check a few other options... Unfortunately our policies are pretty strict on providing cash refunds for weather delays, as those aren't in our control. However, I could issue you a $400 credit that you could use towards rebooking that return flight or other travel within the next 12 months. Would that work a little better for your situation?\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: *sighs again* I don't know, that still doesn't really make up for losing the client. Is there any way you could give me like airfare credit or miles or something instead? I fly United pretty regularly so that would at least be more useful to me.\\\\n\\\\nAgent: You make a good point. Let me pull up your frequent flyer account really quickly...Okay, it looks like based on your flying history over the past two years, I'm willing to deposit 35,000 miles directly into your United MileagePlus account. Those miles never expire and you can use them for award flights or to boost yourself up to higher elite status levels. Does that sound like a better solution than the credit? I'm hoping these extra miles will help make up for the lost business opportunity and frustration from the delay.\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: Hmm... yeah, okay, 35,000 miles does sound a bit better to me. At least that's something I can actually use. Alright, I guess we have a deal then. \\\\n\\\\nAgent: Great, I'm glad we could find a solution you feel good about. Thank you for your patience and for flying with us. I'm going to go ahead and process that mileage deposit now. It may take 24-48 hours to post, but you should see it there by this time next week.

Would there be any wiggle room on that fee since it's only a one day difference? \\\\n\\\\nAgent: I understand the fee seems high for just one day. Unfortunately, since it is within the standard cancellation window for your original flight, the change fee does apply. Let me check if there are any promotions or waivers I could apply for you. *more typing* It doesn't look like I have any promotions to lower the fee currently.

What questions do you have about your trip?\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: Well ahh, I was hoping to change the time of the flight. The one I'm currently booked on leaves at 7am and that's just too early for me after getting into Chicago late the night before. Do you have any other flight options that day with a later departure? \\\\n\\\\nAgent: Let me check on that for you. *more typing* It looks like the only other nonstop flight we have that day leaves at 4pm. We'd need to move you over to that flight and pay any difference in fare. The good news is that flight isn't fully booked yet so we should be able to get you on it. Does that time work better for your travel plans?\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: Hmm yeah 4pm does work a lot better for me. Umm, how much more would that flight cost? My original ticket was pretty cheap so I'm hoping the difference isn't too high. \\\\n\\\\nAgent: Okay, just one second while I pull up the fare information for both flights...alright, it looks like your original 7am flight was our lowest unrestricted fare of $189 each way. The 4pm flight is a higher fare at $249 each way. So the difference to switch over would be $60 each way, for a total additional cost of $120. Does that work for your budget?\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: Ugh, yeah $120 is a bit more than I was hoping to pay. Do you have any other options or is there any way we could maybe lower that cost a little? Flying isn't very high on my list of priorities for this trip. \\\\n\\\\nAgent: Let me check a few other things for you. *more typing and mouse clicking* Unfortunately those are the only two nonstop flight options that day. We don't have any promotions I can apply to lower the fare difference. However, one thing I could try is putting you on a alternate multi-stop itinerary. It would mean flying into Denver a few hours later but it looks like I can reroute you for only a $50 upcharge each way. Would that work better for your travel needs?\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: Hmm, yeah I think I'd prefer to just get there later that day even if it means a connection. As long as the total travel time isn't like super long, $50 each way is definitely more palatable than $120. Can you switch me over to that itinerary?\\\\n\\\\nAgent: Absolutely, let me go ahead and process that change for you now. *typing and clicking sounds* Okay, I've got you all switched over. Your new itinerary will have you flying from Chicago to Minneapolis then connecting to Denver, arriving at 7:45pm. Total travel time is about 6 hours. And the additional cost per ticket is $50 like we discussed.

Let me take a quick look at the flight schedules for that day just to be sure...*more typing* It looks like that flight is still planned to operate on time. We aren't anticipating any cancellations or delays at this point. United has been running very reliably between those cities. Does that help put your mind at ease?\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: Yeah, it does. Thank you for double checking, I feel better knowing the flight is still on schedule. I appreciate you taking the time to reassure me. One more thing, if anything does change with the flight will I get notified?\\\\n\\\\nAgent: You're very welcome, I'm happy I could help alleviate any worries. To answer your question - yes, if there are any updates to your itinerary such as a schedule change or cancellation, we will automatically send notifications to the contact information we have on file for you. We'll alert you by email and also by phone if the change is within a week of your travel date. Does that work for how you'd like to be contacted?\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: Yes, email and phone are both fine. I have the app as well so I'm sure I'd see anything there too. Well thanks so much for your help Sarah, I feel much better now knowing the flight is still set. I really appreciate you taking the time to check for me.\\\\n\\\\nAgent: You're very welcome, it was my pleasure. Thank you for flying United and safe travels to San Francisco next week! Please don't hesitate to call if you have any other questions. You have a good rest of your day.\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: Thanks, you too!

It was supposed to leave Chicago for London at 11am but it's been delayed for over 4 hours now with no explanation. \\\\n\\\\nAgent: I'm sorry to hear that, delays are never fun. Umm, let me pull up your reservation and take a look at what happened. *typing noises* Okay, it looks like there was an issue with the plane this morning. The mechanics found a problem with one of the engines during their pre-flight check and it had to be fixed before the plane could fly. They're still working on it but estimating another hour or two before it'll be ready to go.\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: An hour or two?! Are you kidding me? I have plans I need to make in London tonight. This is unacceptable. \\\\n\\\\nAgent: I completely understand your frustration, miss. These mechanical issues are always unfortunate. Let me see what options we have to get you there sooner. Hmm, it looks like our next nonstop to London isn't until 5pm. Would you consider taking that flight instead and we can compensate you for the inconvenience? We'd be happy to provide a meal voucher and upgrade you to business class as an apology.\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: Ugh, 5pm is no good either, that's going to make me miss my meeting tomorrow morning. What else can you do for me? There has to be something.\\\\n\\\\nAgent: Ah man, I was afraid you'd say that. *typing* Let me check around at other airlines and see if we can get you on another carrier today. Perhaps we can route you through another city to get you arrived in London earlier. Just give me a few minutes to make some calls here...okay, it looks like we can get you on a flight through Newark to London that leaves in about 2 hours and will have you landed by 7pm your time. We'd cover the difference in fare and get you set up in a hotel near the airport for the night before your meeting. How does that sound?\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: I guess that's better than nothing. As long as you guys are paying for everything - the new ticket, hotel, transportation, the whole deal. This has been an absolute nightmare.\\\\n\\\\nAgent: You've got it, we'll take care of all the expenses. And again, I sincerely apologize for all the delays and hassle today. Thank you for your patience and for being a loyal United customer. I'm just going to need to get some information from you to book the new flight and hotel. Can I get your last name and frequent flyer number?\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: It's Smith, number is 4567213. This really better be smoothe sailing from here or there will be hell to pay, you hear me? I need this flight to London to go perfectly. \\\\n\\\\nAgent: You have my word, sir, I'll personally ensure your new itinerary is flawless. Just have your boarding pass emailed to you within the hour and the hotel confirmation as well. And feel free to call me directly if any other issues come up. Thank you again for flying with us today, despite the challenges, and I hope you have a good rest of your trip.\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: Whatever, thanks. *hangs up phone abruptly*\\\\n\\\\nAgent: You're very welcome.

Of course storms can move and forecasts can change, but it doesn't look like any cancellations have been issued yet.

In case of delays or cancellations, I'd like to know my options for either rebooking on a different flight that day if there's availability, or just getting a full refund if needed.\\\\n\\\\nAgent: No problem, we can definitely rebook you or provide a refund if that flight does end up being significantly delayed or cancelled due to the weather. Let me go ahead and add a weather waiver to your reservation. That way if there are any delays over 3 hours or a cancellation, you'll be able to change flights or get your money back with no penalty.

It'll definitely put my mind at ease about the trip. \\\\n\\\\nAgent: You're very welcome, I'm glad I could help provide some reassurance.

This delay has already messed things up enough for me. Can't you get me on an earlier flight?\\\\n\\\\nAgent: I understand your frustration sir, delayed flights are really inconvenient. Let me see if there's any earlier options... *more typing* Unfortunately the flights are booked up solid this morning due to a snowstorm in Chicago. Ah, I may have an option for you, if I can bump someone from an upcoming flight I could get you on the 1pm to Chicago. I'd have to offer them a travel voucher though.

The flight was delayed by over 5 hours and I missed my connecting flight.\\\\n\\\\nAgent: I'm sorry to hear about that delay, that must have been really frustrating for you. Can I get your confirmation number so I can pull up your booking details?\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: Sure, let me find that...it's PX4561JG. *sounds of rustling papers in the background* \\\\n\\\\nAgent: Okay, got it. Let me take a look here...ummm okay, I see the flight on May 15th that was scheduled to leave Chicago at 2pm but didn't actually take off until 7:30pm due to severe weather delays. And you're right, that did cause you to miss your connecting flight to LA. According to our records, we did provide you with a hotel voucher and meal reimbursement for the night, but it doesn't look like we covered anything else. What exactly were you looking for from us now in regards to that flight?\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: Well, the hotel you put me in was pretty terrible and inconveniently located. And I had to spend an extra day in Los Angeles before I could fly back home because of missing that connection. I'm wondering if there's any chance of getting compensated for that lost day. Maybe a travel credit or miles or something? \\\\n\\\\nAgent: Ah I see. Yeah that doesn't sound like the best experience. Let me check what options we might have available for you in a situation like this. *typing and clicking can be heard* Unfortunately with weather delays there isn't much flexibility in our policies. But I'm happy to offer you a $250 travel credit that could be used on a future United ticket.

The new dates I need would be maybe like two weeks later, around April 24th. Is there any way to move it to that date or am I just totally out of luck here?\\\\n\\\\nAgent: Let me check availability for that April 24th date...*more typing* It looks like there is seats available on that flight. I'll go ahead and process a one-time exception to change the dates for you. It will cost a $100 change fee since this is outside of our regular policies.

Can you change me over to that one?\\\\n\\\\nAgent: Sure, I'd be happy to switch your flight for you. Okay, I've gone ahead and processed the change. Your new flight will be departing Chicago at 5:45am and arriving in San Francisco at 8:05am on that Tuesday. You'll be in seat 12A. Does that work for your schedule?\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: Yes, thank you so much for changing that for me Sam, I really appreciate the help. *phone line static* Is there any difference in the ticket price now that I've changed flights?\\\\n\\\\nAgent: You're very welcome, I'm glad I could help get you on an earlier flight. Let me take a quick look at the fare rules for your ticket. It looks like since this is a schedule change being done more than 24 hours before departure, there won't be any additional fees to switch to the new flight time. The price of your ticket will remain the same.\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: Okay perfect, that's great to know. Thanks again for your help today, I feel better knowing I'll get to my meeting on time now. \\\\n\\\\nAgent: You're most welcome.

My name is John Smith, flight number is UAL1245 from Chicago to Los Angeles next Thursday. \\\\n\\\\nAgent: *typing noises* Alright Mr. Smith, I have your reservation pulled up. What questions did you have about the flight?\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: Well first, I just wanted to make sure it's still on schedule. I know there's been a lot of cancellations and delays lately. \\\\n\\\\nAgent: Let me check the status for you. *pause as agent reviews flight info* It looks like your flight is still on time, scheduled to depart at 11:30am and arrive in LA at 2:15pm. No delays or cancellations reported at this time.\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: Okay, that's good to know. I was also wondering, I had booked the ticket with miles but since then some work things have changed and I might need to change the return date by a day or two. Is that something I can do or would I have to pay any fees?\\\\n\\\\nAgent: Let me take a look at the award ticket rules for changes. *typing noises* For miles bookings, you are allowed one free one-time change as long as you do it at least 24 hours before the originally scheduled departure. Since you're asking about the return flight over a week away, you'd be within that window. I'll just need the new return date you want to change it to. Go ahead and tell me and I can process that change for you right now at no charge.\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: Okay great, thanks for checking on that. Umm, let me think for a second about which days might work best... *pause as customer thinks* Ah, is Monday of the following week available? That would be this coming Monday.\\\\n\\\\nAgent: *typing as agent searches flight availability* It looks like we do have seats available to change your return to this coming Monday. I've gone ahead and processed that date change for you. Your new itinerary and boarding passes will be emailed to you within the next 24 hours. Is there anything else I can help you with today?\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: No, I think that covers everything I needed. Thank you so much for your help, I really appreciate you being able to change that return date for me with no issue. It helps a lot.\\\\n\\\\nAgent: You're very welcome, I'm glad I could assist you with that. Thank you for being a loyal United customer.

Let me pull up your reservation. What's the last name the booking is under?\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: Johnson. Flight number is UA108.\\\\n\\\\nAgent: Got it, here is the reservation for Jason Johnson on flight UA108 from Chicago to LA next Wednesday. What's the issue, did you need to change the date of your flight?\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: Yeah, basically my meeting in LA got postponed so I won't need to be there until the following week. Is there any way I can change the date of my flight to the following Wednesday instead? \\\\n\\\\nAgent: Let me check availability for you on that new date. *types on keyboard* Hmm, it looks like that flight is pretty full for the following Wednesday. We do have some seats left on the Thursday morning flight, would that work for your schedule?\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: Thursday would still work, what would the cost be to change it to that day? I know you usually charge a fee.\\\\n\\\\nAgent: No problem, let me take a look at the rebooking fee for that route. *more typing* Okay, since this is more than a week out from your original travel date the fee would be $150 plus any difference in fare. The Thursday flight looks to be about $50 more than what you originally paid. So the total to change it would be $150 + $50, so $200. Does that work for your budget?\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: Hmm, $200 is a bit more than I was hoping to pay. Any way we could waive the change fee just this once since my meeting got postponed? It's really out of my control. \\\\n\\\\nAgent: I understand, events out of our control can definitely throw a wrench in travel plans. Let me see if there's anything I can do here... *more typing as I check supervisor permissions* You know, as a one-time courtesy since this change is due to your meeting getting rescheduled, I think I can waive the change fee for you. The fare difference of $50 would still apply but at least you won't have to pay that $150 fee on top of it. How does that sound?\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: Wow, thank you so much, that's really appreciated. Okay, yeah I can do the $50 difference. Really appreciate you being flexible, it will save me a headache trying to reschedule everything.\\\\n\\\\nAgent: You're very welcome, I'm happy I could help avoid any additional headaches! Okay, I've gone ahead and processed the change to your flight for the following Thursday. The new total will be $50. Your confirmation number and flight details will be the same. Please let me know if you need anything else.\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: That's perfect, thank you again for your help.

Let me take a look at the weather forecast for next Tuesday. *pause as agent checks forecast* Umm yeah, it is showing a 40% chance of some snow in Denver that day. The forecast a few days out isn't always super accurate though. What are you concerned might happen?\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: Well, you know how things can get delayed or canceled if it snows. I just don't want to get stuck in Denver if the flight gets canceled. Is there any way I could change my flight to earlier in the day just to be safe? \\\\n\\\\nAgent: I understand the concern about possible delays or cancellations. Let me see what other flight options we have going out earlier that day. *more typing* It looks like we have some seats available on a 10am flight leaving Denver for Newark. Would you like me to go ahead and switch you over to that one? There would be a $50 change fee but it gets you out a few hours earlier just in case the weather does end up being an issue.\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: Yeah, that 10am flight sounds like a much better option given the forecast. Go ahead and switch me, I'd feel a lot better taking that earlier flight. Can I pay the change fee with my credit card now?\\\\n\\\\nAgent: Absolutely, I'm happy I could find you a better option that gives you some peace of mind.

Let me see what I can do for you as far as compensation goes. I'm booking you on a new flight leaving Chicago this afternoon that will have you home this evening. As for a refund, unfortunately because the delay was due to severe weather we won't be able to provide you with a full ticket refund. However, I can credit your account with a $350 travel voucher that you can use on a future United purchase.

We have another non-stop flight that departs Chicago at 10am and will get you into LA at 1pm, would that work better?\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: Yeah that 10am flight sounds a lot better. What would it cost to switch to that one? I'm assuming there would be a fee or something since it's so close to the travel date?\\\\n\\\\nAgent: *sighs* You're right, since it's within a week of your travel there would be a change fee. Let me check...the fee to change to the 10am flight would be $150 plus any difference in fare. The good news is the fare is the same for both flights so it's just the $150 change fee. Does that work for you?\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: Ah man, $150 is kinda steep. Umm is there any way you could maybe waive that fee or reduce it at all? Money is a bit tight right now so I'm trying to avoid extra costs if possible. \\\\n\\\\nAgent: I understand, change fees can really add up. Let me see if there's anything I can do...*keyboard typing* Unfortunately at this point in time there isn't much flexibility on the change fee since it's so close to your travel date. I could potentially offer to reduce it to $100 if that helps at all? Otherwise the only other option would be to keep your original flight.\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: Man this is tough. I really don't want to leave that early if I don't have to. Alright, you know what, go ahead and switch me to that 10am flight but can you invoice me for the $100 change fee instead of charging it now? I get paid in a few days so I can pay it then. \\\\n\\\\nAgent: I appreciate you working with me on this. Okay, let me go ahead and process that flight change for you. Just to confirm, I'm changing you from the 6am departure on Tuesday to the 10am flight and I'll invoice you for the $100 change fee, due within 7 days. Does that work?\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: Yeah, that works perfect. Thank you so much for your help, I really appreciate you being able to reduce the fee for me.\\\\n\\\\nAgent: You're very welcome, I'm happy I could help find a solution.

What do you think, will that work with your schedule?\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: Ugh I don't really want to have to make a connection but I guess if it's my only option. As long as you guarantee I'll make that connection in Denver, I really don't want to be stranded at another airport. And I better get some kind of compensation for this complete disaster of a travel day. \\\\n\\\\nAgent: I completely understand your frustration and wanting to avoid another connection if possible. Let me go ahead and get you booked on that itinerary with the stop in Denver. As for compensation, I'll be happy to provide you with a $300 travel voucher that can be used for any future United flight. The voucher will be emailed to you within the next 24 hours. I'll also note your record that you should be exempt from any future change fees, just in case any issues come up. Please let me know once you have your boarding pass printed so I know you're all set. I hope the rest of your travel goes smoothly!\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: Ugh fine, I guess that will have to do then. This has seriously been the worst experience. Can you just email me the boarding pass then so I can get through security? I really appreciate you helping me get on that other flight. \\\\n\\\\nAgent: No problem, I completely understand your frustration. Just sent the email with your new itinerary and boarding pass. Please keep an eye out for it and let me know if you have any other issues. Thank you so much for your patience today and I hope the rest of your travel goes smoothly. Enjoy your time in Seattle!\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: Okay great, thanks. I'll try to enjoy it I guess. Thanks for your help, have a good one. *call disconnects*\\\\n\\\\nAgent: You're very welcome, and thank you for flying United.

How can I help you today?\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: Hi, yeah I'm calling because I'm really upset about my recent flight. It was just a nightmare from start to finish. \\\\n\\\\nAgent: I'm sorry to hear you had a bad experience. Can you tell me what happened?\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: Well first of all, your website said my flight was departing from gate C17 but when I got to the airport they had changed it to A11 with no warning. So I had to rush to the other side of the terminal. And then when I got on the plane, they didn't have any overhead bin space left so I had to check my carry on, which made me late getting off the plane. And to top it all off, when I sat down my screen wasn't working so I couldn't even watch a movie to pass the time. It was outrageous. \\\\n\\\\nAgent: Hmm, that does sound really frustrating. A few things going wrong can really ruin a travel experience. Umm, let me pull up your flight details and take a look. *typing noises* Okay, I see the notes here that your original departure gate was changed due to a plane swap. We should have sent an email or text alert about that, sorry we missed notifying you. As for the overhead bins, I know how stressful that can be rushing to get off. And the screens, ugh those things do have a mind of their own sometimes. Not the trip you were hoping for at all.\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: No, it wasn't. And to make matters worse, when I got home and tried to file a complaint online, your website crashed. I was on hold for over an hour just to talk to someone. This is ridiculous customer service. \\\\n\\\\nAgent: Oh man, I apologize but it sounds like you've really had it with us so far. The website crashing is inexcusable too. Let me see what I can do to make this up to you. *more typing* As a loyal customer who flies with us frequently, I'm going to credit your account with a $150 travel voucher that's valid for your next two United flights. And I'll also reimburse you for the cost of checking your bag since that delay was our fault. Will that help make the bad experience a little better?\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: I guess $150 is better than nothing. But honestly, I'm just so fed up with all the problems every time I fly United. At this point it's not even worth it dealing with the hassle. \\\\n\\\\nAgent: Yeah, I completely understand your frustration. These issues really shouldn't be happening and it's unacceptable that they ruined your trip. Let me see if there's anything else I can do... Ah, it looks like we have seats still available on a direct Delta flight to your destination city next Thursday. If you'd like, I can book you on that and refund the difference in fare. Would you rather switch airlines going forward?  \\\\n\\\\nCustomer: You know, that Delta flight actually works better for me schedule-wise. Alright, go ahead and switch me over to that. And please don't charge me any change fees or difference in price. I've had more than enough hassle from United.\\\\n\\\\nAgent: No problem at all, I fully understand. Just one moment while I process the refund and booking for you...there, all set! Your United flight is now completely cancelled and refunded, and you're confirmed on the Delta flight next Thursday. Thank you so much for your patience and for being a loyal customer all these years. I really hope this makes up for the terrible experience and that your future travels go much smoother. Please don't hesitate to call back if you ever need anything else.\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: Okay, thanks I appreciate you helping to fix this. Have a good one.\\\\n\\\\nAgent: You too, take care and safe travels!\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: *hangs up* Ugh, finally.\\\\n\\\\nThat concludes the 452-second call transcript between the angry United customer and sympathetic agent.

Umm my flight from Chicago to New York is supposed to leave in 2 hours but it's been delayed.\\\\n\\\\nAgent: I'm sorry to hear that your flight is delayed. Can I get your confirmation number so I can take a look at the details?\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: *customer provides confirmation number* This is ridiculous, now I'm going to miss my connection to London. You guys better get me on another flight today.\\\\n\\\\nAgent: Let me pull up your reservation. *typing noises* Okay, it looks like your flight from Chicago to New York is delayed due to maintenance issues on the aircraft. The current estimated departure time is 3 hours from now. For the inconvenience, I can get you booked on the next direct flight to New York which leaves in an hour. How does that sound?\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: An hour? That's still cutting it close for my connection. Don't you have anything earlier? \\\\n\\\\nAgent: Let me check some other options for you. *more typing* Unfortunately the next few flights to New York are also delayed or full due to a storm that's moving through the area. The one in an hour is the earliest I can get you out on. I can try putting you on standby for an earlier flight if any seats open up but I can't guarantee it. Would you like me to go ahead and book you on the one-hour flight?\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: Ugh, I don't know. This is such a pain. I really need to make that flight to London tonight for work. Can't you get me on a different airline or something?\\\\n\\\\nAgent: I understand your frustration, missing an international connection can really mess things up. Let me see if I have any options to get you to New York on another carrier. *more typing* It looks like American and Delta both have flights leaving for New York within the next 30 minutes but they're fully booked as well. I could try putting you on standby for those too. Alternatively, I can book you a flight to Newark on a smaller airline leaving in 45 minutes and arrange for a car service to take you from Newark to JFK for your international connection. How's that sound?\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: Ah man, I don't know. Newark is pretty far from JFK, I'd be cutting it really close. Can't you get me on a direct flight from here to JFK instead of Newark?\\\\n\\\\nAgent: Unfortunately there aren't any other nonstop options from Chicago to JFK within the next few hours due to the weather delays. I know it's not ideal but taking the flight to Newark and arranging the car may be your best bet to still make your international connection tonight. I can reimburse you for the car service as well. What do you think, should I book that itinerary for you?\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: Ugh, fine I guess that's my only choice then. Go ahead and book it. But you guys better give me some miles or something for this huge hassle.\\\\n\\\\nAgent: Absolutely, I'll be sure to note a goodwill gesture on your account for the multiple flight changes and delays out of your control. Just want to confirm I have you booked on Delta flight 1264 leaving O'Hare in 45 minutes going to Newark, and I've arranged a car to take you from Newark Airport to JFK upon arrival. Please let me know the car service driver's name when you get picked up and I'll process the reimbursement. Is there anything else I can do for you today?\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: No I think that's it. Thanks I guess, even though this is still going to be really tight. Now I gotta run to catch that flight.\\\\n\\\\nAgent: You're very welcome and I apologize again for the complications. Please let me know if you have any other issues. Safe travels and I hope you make your international flight okay.

I wanted to double check what time my flight is scheduled to depart.\\\\n\\\\nAgent: No problem, let me pull up your reservation. Can I get your last name please? \\\\n\\\\nCustomer: Sure, it's under Smith. John Smith.\\\\n\\\\nAgent: Okay, let me see here... *typing noises* Ah okay, I've got your reservation here Mr. Smith. Your flight from Chicago to New York is scheduled to depart at 12:30pm next Friday. Does that sound right?\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: Hmm, I thought it might have been earlier in the day. Let me double check my confirmation email real quick... *paper shuffling* Yep, you're right Tom it's showing as a 12:30pm departure. Thanks for checking on that for me.\\\\n\\\\nAgent: You're very welcome, happy I could confirm the details for you. Is there anything else I can help with regarding your travel plans?\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: Well, I had one other question. I'm traveling with my wife and two kids, ages 5 and 7. We were hoping to get seats all together on the flight. When I booked I didn't select seats, so are those automatically assigned yet? Or do I need to go in and pick them?\\\\n\\\\nAgent: Good question. For flights that are still a week out, seats typically haven't been assigned yet automatically. I'd recommend going into your reservation on our website or mobile app to select your seats together before they get assigned by the system. You'll want to do that sooner than later since families traveling together tend to grab up those rows of 4 seats together pretty quickly as we get closer to departure. Does that help explain the seat selection process?\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: Yeah, that's really helpful. I'll be sure to log in tonight and pick our seats. One last thing, is there any chance of upgrading to seats with more legroom? We're bringing car seats which can be a tight fit in regular economy.\\\\n\\\\nAgent: Let me check on upgrade availability and pricing for you. *typing noises* It looks like we do have some extra legroom Economy Plus seats still available for your flight. Upgrading all four seats would be an additional $80 per person each way, so $320 roundtrip total. Does that price work for your travel budget? I know those car seats can definitely take up extra space.\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: You know, that actually isn't too bad considering. I think we'll go ahead and upgrade, it will make the flight much more comfortable. Can you process that for us?\\\\n\\\\nAgent: Absolutely, just give me one moment to make those changes to your reservation... *more typing* Okay, all set! I've upgraded all four seats to Economy Plus and the payment has been processed. You should see the new seats and fare total reflected in your confirmation email and online reservation. Please let me know if you need anything else at all!\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: Wonderful, thank you so much for your help Tom. Really appreciate you taking the time to answer all my questions.

May I have your confirmation number so I can take a look at your reservation?\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: *customer provides confirmation number* this is ridiculous, I have an important meeting to attend tomorrow that I now might miss because of this delay. \\\\n\\\\nAgent: *typing sounds* Okay, let me pull up your reservation.

I'll have to move you to a different airline but it will minimize the disruption to your travel plans. How does that sound?\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: 11pm arrival? That's cutting it really close to my meeting tomorrow morning. Don't you have anything earlier? I've been at this airport for hours already because of this delay.\\\\n\\\\nAgent: You're right, an 11pm arrival would be tight. Just let me check a few other itineraries.. *typing sounds* It looks like I may have found a better option. If we can get you on the 8pm flight to San Francisco with American Airlines, you would land by 9:15pm which gives you more time before your meeting. I'd have to move you to a different airline but would that work better for you? I know you've had a long day already due to the delay.\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: Ugh, yeah I guess the 8pm flight with American is better than nothing. This has been such a hassle, is there anything you can do for me as compensation for the delay?\\\\n\\\\nAgent: I completely understand your frustration with the delayed flight today. Let me see what I can do for you.. *typing sounds* As an apology for the inconvenience, I'm happy to provide you with a $150 travel voucher that can be used for future United flights. I'm also waiving the change fee for moving you to the American Airlines flight this evening. Does this help make up for some of the hassle you've experienced today?\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: You know what, that actually sounds fair. Alright, go ahead and switch me over to that 8pm American flight then. And thank you for the travel voucher, I appreciate you trying to help smooth things over. *sighs* Just glad I'll make it to my meeting on time now. \\\\n\\\\nAgent: You're very welcome, I'm glad we could work something out that gets you to your destination on time.

What kind of airline runs out of food? \\\\n\\\\nAgent: One second let me pull up your record...okay I see your flight here from last Wednesday. I'm sorry to hear about the multiple delays, the weather was really bad along the east coast that day which caused several flights to be backed up. In terms of running out of food, that's definitely not ideal. Was any compensation provided like meal vouchers for your next flight?\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: No! I mean they gave us some tiny packets of pretzels but I was supposed to be in San Fran for a business meeting. Because of the delay I missed important clients. Don't you guys plan ahead for delays and have extra food? This is ridiculous. \\\\n\\\\nAgent: You're right to be frustrated, missing business opportunities because of travel delays is never good. Let me take a look here...it looks like due to the extended length of the delay and now knowing you had important meetings, you would qualify for a partial refund of the ticket cost. I can credit that back to the original form of payment. As for ensuring extra food supplies, that's a good point and I'll pass that feedback along to the proper department so they can better plan to avoid running out during lengthy delays. How does a 25% refund of the ticket price sound to help make up for the missed meetings?\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: Only 25%? That flight cost me almost $800, your delays probably cost me thousands in lost business. I want at least half back. \\\\n\\\\nAgent: You make a fair argument. I'll go ahead and process a 50% refund of the $800 ticket price, so $400 will be credited back to your card. Thank you for bringing this to my attention, ensuring customer satisfaction after a delay is so important. I hope this helps make up for some of the losses.

Can I get your confirmation number or last name so I can look up your reservation?\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: Sure, it's under the last name Smith, confirmation number is B58392.\\\\n\\\\nAgent: Alright, let me pull that up... *typing noises* Okay Mr. Smith, I see you have flight 1982 from Chicago to Denver departing next Tuesday at 10:30am. What questions did you have about that reservation?\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: Well the thing is, something came up at work and I actually need to change my return flight to an earlier date. Is there any way I can move that flight to Monday instead of Tuesday?\\\\n\\\\nAgent: *sighs* I understand, things come up. Let me take a look at our flight availability for Monday. Umm...it looks like we don't have any nonstop flights from Denver to Chicago that day. The closest I see is a connector flight that would get you into Chicago at 7:15pm. Would that work for your schedule or are you trying to get back earlier than that?\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: Ah man, 7:15pm gets me back pretty late. Any chance there's an earlier flight even if it has a layover? I'd really like to try to get back by the afternoon if possible. \\\\n\\\\nAgent: No problem, let me check some other routing options...hmm it looks like if you're willing to fly back through Houston, we have a flight leaving Denver at 11:35am and connecting in Houston with an arrival back in Chicago at 3:45pm. How does that sound?\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: You know, that Houston connection might work. As long as the layover isn't too long. How long would the stop be?\\\\n\\\\nAgent: Let me double check the timing on that...the flight from Denver to Houston would arrive at 1:45pm and then your connecting flight to Chicago would depart at 2:25pm, so about a 40 minute layover. Does that timing work okay with your schedule?\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: Yeah, a 40 minute layover is doable. Alright, I'll go ahead and change my flight to that itinerary then. What do I need to do on my end?\\\\n\\\\nAgent: Great, I'm happy we could find an option that will work for your schedule change. To make the change, I'll need to collect a $150 fee per ticket for changing the flight outside of our refundable ticket guidelines. Would you like me to go ahead and process that fee on the credit card you booked with?\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: Yeah, go ahead and charge it to the card. I really appreciate you helping me out with this John. Thanks for squeezing me in on that earlier flight.\\\\n\\\\nAgent: You're very welcome, I'm glad we could accommodate the change. One moment while I process everything...okay it looks all set. You'll receive an email confirmation shortly reflecting the new itinerary and charge. Please let me know if you have any other questions. Safe travels!\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: Thank you so much for your help! I really appreciate you taking the time.

Is that something I can do?\\\\n\\\\nAgent: No problem, let me take a look at your reservation. What's the name the flight is booked under?\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: It's under John Smith.\\\\n\\\\nAgent: Okay, let me pull that up... *typing noises* Alright, I've got the reservation here for John Smith traveling from Chicago to London next Wednesday. What was the original return date and what date would you like to change it to?\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: The original return date was for the following Tuesday but I need to stay an extra week. Can I change it to leave the following Tuesday instead? \\\\n\\\\nAgent: Let me check availability and pricing for that date. *more typing* It looks like we do have seats available on that return flight. The good news is because you're changing the date more than 21 days in advance, there won't be a fee for the change. However, the fare for that day is a little higher. It would be an additional $150 per ticket. Does that work for you?\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: Hmm, an extra $150 is more than I was wanting to pay. umm, is there any chance of finding a cheaper option maybe leaving a few days later? I'm pretty flexible on the exact return date.\\\\n\\\\nAgent: No problem, let me see what other dates closer to that time look like... *even more typing and clicking of a mouse* It looks like if you changed it to leave the following Saturday instead, I can get you on that flight for only an additional $50 per ticket. Would that work better for your schedule?\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: Yeah, leaving on the Saturday works great actually. Go ahead and update it for me please.\\\\n\\\\nAgent: Okay, I've just made that change to your itinerary. You'll now be returning from London on the following Saturday instead of the original Tuesday. You're all set! The additional $50 per ticket will be charged to the original form of payment on file.

I'll do my best to answer your question.\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: Sure, so I have a flight from New York to LA next Thursday. I was checking my reservation on the app and it looks like the departure time got pushed back by 2 hours. Is there a reason for that? Will I get compensated for the change?\\\\n\\\\nAgent: Let me take a look at your reservation details Sarah. *typing noises* Okay, it looks like there was a scheduling change made to that flight due to some maintenance work that needs to be done on the airplane. The new departure time is two hours later than originally scheduled. In regards to compensation, since this was a change made by United, you are entitled to a refund for any airport transportation or parking fees you may incur as a result of the later departure. I can certainly process that refund for you now if you have those costs available. As for the delay itself, unfortunately we don't provide compensation for delays under 3 hours in this situation since it was due to maintenance which ensures the longterm safety of our aircraft. I apologize for any inconvenience the change causes.\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: Okay I understand about the maintenance, safety has to come first. The new departure will still get me to LA in time for my meeting on Friday though, right? \\\\n\\\\nAgent: Let me double check the arrival time for you...*more typing noises* Yes, with the two hour later departure, you should still arrive in LA just before 7pm on Thursday which gives you plenty of time before your meeting on Friday. The flight time itself remains the same, just the departure is pushed back a couple hours. Does this help reassure you that you'll make your meeting on time?\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: Yes, that's very helpful. As long as I get there in time, I'm not too worried about the departure change. I appreciate you taking the time to look into that for me Steve. \\\\n\\\\nAgent: You're very welcome Sarah, I'm glad I could provide you with that reassurance. Safety is our top priority at United so I'm sure the maintenance check will help ensure many more reliable flights. Thanks for understanding that small departure change.

Let me take a look at what options we have available to get you to New York. *typing sounds* Umm, it looks like the next nonstop flight leaving Chicago tomorrow isn't until the evening. Would that work for your travel plans?\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: No, that won't work at all. I have an important business meeting first thing in the morning that I have to be there for. Is there any way to get me on an earlier flight even if it has a layover? I'm willing to pay more if I have to. I need to get there tomorrow!\\\\n\\\\nAgent: I understand your frustration, missing a business meeting is never ideal. Let me see what I can do...*more typing* Unfortunately all the direct flights for tomorrow are booked up. The earliest I see that would get you into New York in time for your meeting has a layover in Detroit. It would be on a different airline though through our partners. You'd leave Chicago at 6am and arrive in New York at 9:45am. Does that work for you? It would be an additional $150 fee to change your booking.\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: Ugh, a layover, but I guess if that's the only way. Yeah, go ahead and book me on that flight then. This is unacceptable though, you guys cancelled my original flight with no notice. I'm an extremely loyal customer of yours and fly with United all the time for business. You can't treat people this way.\\\\n\\\\nAgent: I completely understand your frustration, sir. These last minute cancellations are never ideal. Let me go ahead and book you on that itinerary with the layover in Detroit then. Just to be sure, the name is John Smith and you'll be paying with the Amex on file, correct? *customer confirms* Okay, it's all booked. As an apology for the inconvenience, I'm also going to credit your account with a $150 flight voucher that's good for future travel within the next year. Thank you for your loyalty to United over the years. I hope this helps make up for the hassle today. Please let me know if there's anything else I can do for you before we end the call.\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: Alright, well I appreciate you getting me rebooked at least. This voucher better be real though, you guys have messed up promises like this before. If there's any other issues with this new flight, you can bet I'll be calling back to complain some more. Have a good one. \\\\n\\\\nAgent: You have my word the voucher will be valid when you're ready to book your next trip. And please do call us right back if you experience any other issues. It was nice speaking with you and I'm sorry again for all the problems.

Is there anything direct I can take?\\\\n\\\\nAgent: *typing quickly* Hmm, the only other direct flight I see leaves at 6:30am which would get you in at 9:45am. However, that flight is fully booked.

Is there any way I can change it to the following Monday instead without paying a change fee?\\\\n\\\\nAgent: Umm, let me check the rules for that specific fare. *more typing* It looks like since you booked the basic economy fare, there is a $200 change fee to change the date.

But I just found out I have a work meeting that got moved to that morning. Is there any way I can change my flight to an earlier one that day?\\\\n\\\\nAgent: Let me check on that for you. What's the flight number of your original booking? *typing sounds* Umm just one second while I pull up your reservation...okay I've got it here. You're flying from O'Hare to LAX next Thursday, departing at 11am, correct?\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: Yes, that's right. \\\\n\\\\nAgent: Alright, it looks like we do have some earlier options that might work better for your meeting. We have a flight that leaves at 8:15am, would that work with your new schedule?\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: Hmm, let me check... *pause as customer checks calendar* Yeah the 8:15 flight would be perfect actually. How much would it cost to change to that one?\\\\n\\\\nAgent: Let me take a look at the fare difference here... *more typing noises* okay, so because this is a schedule change within the same day, there would usually be a fee of $100 to process the change. But since you're a frequent flyer with us, I'm able to waive that fee for you just this once. The difference in fare between the flights is $50, so that would be the total cost to swap to the 8:15am flight.\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: Ah okay, that's not too bad. Yeah go ahead and switch me over to that earlier flight then please.\\\\n\\\\nAgent: No problem, I'm just going to need to get some verification from you first before processing the change.

Do you have any seats available on the 14th?\\\\n\\\\nAgent: Hmm let me check the flight for the 14th. *typing sounds* It looks like that flight is pretty full, the only seat I have left is in economy plus in the back.

I'm already stressed enough as it is with this work thing and now United is going to make me sit in the very back?

However, I do see that there is still one seat left in the exit row for the 14th, which offers a little more legroom. Would you like me to switch you over to that seat? There would be a $75 change fee applied.\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: An exit row, huh? I guess that's better than nothing. Alright fine, go ahead and change me.

Let me check if there's anything I can do as far as making up the price difference since you've had trouble with the site. *more typing* Unfortunately that return route is our red-eye flight which normally has limited availability. But I was able to get you on the same flight for Wednesday, it'll just be an additional $150. I know that's not ideal, is there any way I can help reduce that fee a little since you've had issues?\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: Ugh $150 is a lot. Any chance you have any flight credit or something from the last time I had problems with a reservation? I feel like this is becoming a pattern with United. \\\\n\\\\nAgent: You know, let me double check your past records really quickly...*typing noises* Yes, it looks like last year you had an issue on a flight from Chicago to New York where you arrived late due to a delay and missed your connecting flight. We did provide you with a $100 credit at that time due to the inconvenience. I'm going to apply that credit now to your reservation to help offset the price increase. That will bring your additional cost down to only $50. How does that sound?\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: You know, I appreciate you looking into that John. $50 is definitely more reasonable than $150. Alright, I guess that will work then. Thanks for your help.\\\\n\\\\nAgent: You're very welcome, I'm glad we were able to find a solution. Thank you for your patience during this process. I've gone ahead and updated your flight to the Wednesday return and applied the $100 credit. You should receive an email confirmation shortly.

Does that 10:30 time work better for your schedule?\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: You know, the 10:30 flight might work. Does that flight still allow me to keep my return flight from SF back to Chicago on the original date? I'd hate to have to change that part of it too.\\\\n\\\\nAgent: Let me double check that for you...*more typing*...yes, switching you to the 10:30am departure will keep your existing return flight on the same date intact.

I just wanted to double check since the email mentioned a possible change. Uh, is there any news about the weather in Boston for next Thursday? I saw something about a chance of snow.\\\\n\\\\nAgent: No problem, I'm glad I could confirm the departure time for you. Let me take a quick look at the weather forecast. *typing again* According to the forecast I'm seeing, there is a 40% chance of some snow in Boston on Thursday. It doesn't look like a huge storm, but it is possible there could be a few inches of accumulation. The forecast can still change a bit between now and then though. Unless the weather looks really bad, your flight should still be on schedule. But I'd check back closer to your travel date just in case. Does that help give you a better idea of what to expect?\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: Yeah, that's helpful. Hopefully it's not too bad. One more question - if the flight did end up getting delayed or canceled because of the weather, what are my options for rebooking or getting a refund? \\\\n\\\\nAgent: No problem. If your flight were to be delayed or canceled due to weather, here are your options: For delays under 2 hours, we wouldn't rebook you - you'd just wait it out. For longer delays, we'd re-route you either directly to your destination or via another nearby airport on our network. You could also opt for a full refund if you no longer want to travel. For cancellations, we'd rebook you on the next available United flight or one of our partner airline flights if needed. You could instead choose a refund as well. I'd be happy to rebook you myself if any changes are needed - just give us a call back. Does that help explain the process?\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: Yeah, that makes sense. Thanks for walking through all that with me, I feel a lot better prepared now. I think that's all the questions I had for today.\\\\n\\\\nAgent: You're very welcome, I'm glad I could help put your mind at ease. Thank you for calling United Airlines customer service.

I apologize that the crew was not very helpful when you asked for assistance. *pause* How may I make this right for you today? \\\\n\\\\nCustomer: I want a full refund and some airline credits. Five hours stuck on a plane is unacceptable. You guys need to do better.\\\\n\\\\nAgent: You're right, that long of a delay is beyond your control. I can certainly issue you a refund for the cost of the ticket. As for credits, let me see what I can do... Umm, how does $500 in flight credits for future travel sound? I'll also note your record that you had poor customer service on this flight so you earn elite status qualifications sooner. Is that acceptable?\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: *sighs* I guess that'll have to do. It's just so annoying that I wasted a whole day with your airline. You guys really need to get it together.\\\\n\\\\nAgent: I understand your frustration completely, and I apologize again for the poor experience. Thank you for bringing this to my attention - customer feedback is so important for us to improve. I hope the refund and credits help make up for it at least a little. Please feel free to reach back out if you have any other issues in the future. Safe travels!\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: Yeah, thanks. *call disconnects*\\\\n\\\\nAgent: Thank you for your call.

I'm calling because I need to make a change to my flight scheduled for next week.\\\\n\\\\nAgent: No problem John, what change did you need to make to your reservation?\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: Well, umm.. my plans have changed a bit and I need to move my return flight from next Thursday to this coming Monday instead. Is there any way to change that on my reservation? \\\\n\\\\nAgent: Let me pull up your reservation and take a look John. *typing noises* Okay, I see here that your original return flight next Thursday is on a full flight. Let me check availability for this Monday... *more typing* It looks like we do have seats available on a flight leaving on Monday around 4pm, would that work for your plans?\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: Yeah, that Monday flight at 4pm would be perfect. How much would it cost to change it?\\\\n\\\\nAgent: Just one moment while I check the fare difference and change fees for moving it up... *typing and mouse clicks* Alright, because this is being done within the standard change window before your travel dates there would be a $150 fee per ticket to make the change but no additional fare difference since the prices are about the same. Does that fee work for your budget?\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: Hmm, $150 does seem like a lot just to change the date. Is there any way you could maybe waive that fee or reduce it at all since it's still over a week before my original return date?\\\\n\\\\nAgent: I completely understand where you're coming from, John. Unfortunately our change fees are pretty standard across all our flights. Let me take a look here though and see if there's anything I can possibly do for you... *more typing and clicks* It looks like based on your customer status with us from past flights, I may be able to offer a one-time courtesy reduction to lower the change fee to $75 per ticket instead. How does that sound?\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: You know, $75 is still a bit more than I was hoping to pay. Would it be possible to switch just to a full refund instead of changing the date? Then I could go buy the new flight again.\\\\n\\\\nAgent: Ah good thinking, John. Let me run through the refund process instead... *keyboard typing* Okay, if we process a full refund back to your original form of payment for the Thursday flight, then yes you'd be able to book the new Monday flight at the current fare without any change fees or additional costs. Just a few more questions to finalize the refund - do you have your confirmation number handy so I can pull up the exact reservation details?\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: Umm, let me check my email for that confirmation... *papers shuffling, typing on computer* Okay, I've got it here, the confirmation number is HXE499. Will I get the refund back today once it's processed? Flying standby has me all turned around on my plans haha.\\\\n\\\\nAgent: No problem at all, totally understand. Alright, I've got the reservation pulled up with that confirmation number. It looks like the refund should process back to your card within the next 2-3 business days. In the meantime, go ahead and book that new flight for Monday at 4pm if you want to secure that spot. Do you need any help with that or think you can handle it online yourself?\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: I think I can book it online, it shouldn't be too hard. Thank you so much for your help today, Steve! I really appreciate you working with me on this.\\\\n\\\\nAgent: You're very welcome, John. I'm glad we were able to find a good solution for you. Safe travels and enjoy the rest of your trip!

I'm a little concerned about the weather forecast. \\\\n\\\\nAgent: Okay, no problem. Let me pull up your booking details. What's the flight number?\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: It's flight UA908.\\\\n\\\\nAgent: Got it, let me take a look... *typing noises* Alright, I'm looking at the weather forecast for next Monday. It is showing some potential for storms in the Chicago area but nothing too severe. The forecast can always change though. What aspect of the weather has you concerned?\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: Well the forecast is saying there's a 60% chance of rain and thunderstorms on Monday afternoon when my flight is due to take off. I'm just a bit worried about potential delays or cancellations if the storms are bad. \\\\n\\\\nAgent: Yeah, I can understand your concern. The spring weather in Chicago can be unpredictable. *sighs* Let me see what options we have if the flight does get delayed or cancelled due to weather. Umm... it looks like we have a few alternate flights later that evening we could potentially move you to. Or if the storms are really bad and cause significant disruptions, we may need to rebook you for the following day. How flexible is your schedule on the other side?\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: Not super flexible unfortunately. I'm traveling for a work conference in London on the Tuesday and Wednesday so I really need to be there on Monday night. Any delays or missing that flight would make me miss the start of the conference. \\\\n\\\\nAgent: Ah shoot, that's not ideal then. *pause* You know, given the timing of the storms in the forecast and the importance of you making that conference, I might suggest looking at flying out a day earlier just to be safe. Would moving your flight to this coming Sunday be possible? There's availability on an earlier flight that day that should get you into London with plenty of time before the conference starts.\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: Hmm Sunday could work actually, as long as the price is about the same. How much would it be to change it to Sunday?\\\\n\\\\nAgent: Let me check prices for Sunday really quick... *typing noises* Okay, good news - I'm actually seeing the Sunday flight is only about $50 more than what you've already paid for Monday. I know that's not a small amount but given the uncertainty of the weather and not wanting to risk missing your conference, it may be worth the peace of mind. And if the weather ends up being fine on Monday, at least you've got an extra day in London! What do you think, does moving to Sunday work for you?\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: You know, that does sound like a better plan given the forecast. Alright, go ahead and switch me over to that Sunday flight then please. And thank you for taking the time to help come up with a good backup plan, I feel much better about things now.\\\\n\\\\nAgent: No problem at all, I'm happy I could help put your mind at ease. Just give me one moment to process the change...okay, all set! You're now booked on UA235 departing Chicago Sunday at 1:05pm and arriving in London at 6:25pm. Everything should go smoothly that way.

It looks like your flight from Chicago to LA was delayed due to severe weather in Chicago. The flight ended up departing around 3 hours late. Do you need help rebooking your travel for the delayed segment?\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: Ugh yeah that's really frustrating. I had plans I needed to get to in LA and now everything is messed up because of this delay. Is there any way I can get compensation for this?\\\\n\\\\nAgent: I understand the delay caused some inconvenience to your travel plans. Let me take a look at our policies and what options may be available to assist you... *more typing sounds* According to our records, this flight was delayed due to circumstances outside of our control like weather. In situations like this where the delay was due to factors we can't control, our policies don't allow for monetary compensation. However, I'd be happy to take a look at some alternative options to help make this right. What were you thinking would be most helpful in this situation?\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: Ah man, I was really hoping for a refund or something. This delay really threw a wrench in my plans. Is there any upgrade I could get on a future flight or any miles or something? I'm just really frustrated with how this all went down. \\\\n\\\\nAgent: I completely understand your frustration. Delays are never fun, especially when you have plans that end up getting disrupted. Let me see what I can do for you...it looks like I can offer you a $100 travel voucher that's good for any future United purchase within the next year. I can also add 15,000 bonus miles to your frequent flyer account. How does that sound as a way to help make up for the inconvenience caused by the delay? I'm happy to explore any other options as well if those don't fully make up for the trouble.\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: *sighs* You know, that travel voucher and miles will have to do I guess. I'm just annoyed it took so long to even get a flight out and I had to cancel dinner plans and everything. Next time I'm taking a different airline.\\\\n\\\\nAgent: I really appreciate your understanding. Delays are certainly no fun when you've got plans disrupted. Thank you for your patience as well - I know delayed flights can be frustrating to deal with. Please let me know if there's anything else I can do to help make this right. And I apologize again for the trouble caused by the late departure.\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: Alright, well thanks for your help I guess.

Your flight from Chicago to San Francisco is currently on schedule to leave next Thursday at 5:30pm. The flight time is around 5 hours. Does that match what you have?\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: Yes, that's correct. I just wanted to double check because it looked like there was some bad weather in Chicago forecast for next week. \\\\n\\\\nAgent: Ah yes, I see what you mean. Let me take a look at the forecast for next Thursday...*more typing* It does look like there is a chance of storms in the Chicago area that day. Nothing is guaranteed of course, but based on the current forecast, there is a 40% chance of rain during your departure time. The good news is our aircraft are well equipped to handle moderate rain. But I would recommend signing up for flight alerts just in case of any potential delays. That way you'll get notified right away if the status changes. Does that put your mind at ease or is there anything else I can help with?\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: Yeah, that helps, thanks. As long as it's not looking like a huge storm that would cancel flights or something. I just wanted to double check before I finalize my hotel in San Francisco for that night. Is there a good number I can call to check on flight status in the days leading up to it? \\\\n\\\\nAgent: Absolutely, I'm glad I could help provide some clarity. For flight status updates anytime before your travel date, the best number is 1-800-864-8331. You'll be able to check on your flight by entering your confirmation number or last name into the automated system. They can provide you with up-to-the-minute updates on delays, gate changes, etc. I'd recommend checking again on Tuesday before your Thursday flight just to be safe.

Let me take a look at our flight options for an earlier return... *typing continues* Okay, it looks like we have seats available on a flight departing Newark at 3pm on Tuesday and returning to Chicago. The fare would be an additional $150 since you're making a significant change to your itinerary. Would you like me to go ahead and update your return date?\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: Hmm, $150 is a bit more than I was hoping to pay. Any chance I could get a cheaper option? Work has been really stressful lately and I don't wanna spend too much if possible. \\\\n\\\\nAgent: No problem, let me see if there are any other cost-effective alternatives...*more typing* It looks like we have one flight leaving Newark at 6pm on Tuesday that would only be an additional $50 to change your return. However, the layover in Detroit would be a bit longer at around 3 hours. Would that 6pm flight work better for your schedule?\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: Yeah, I think I can make that 6pm flight work. And $50 is definitely more doable for me right now. If it's not too much trouble, can you go ahead and update my return for that flight? I really appreciate you taking the time to help me out. Work has been super hectic lately.\\\\n\\\\nAgent: You're very welcome, I'm happy I could find an affordable option to help accommodate your schedule change.

I know that's not ideal, but given the short notice for your change of plans it's one of the more reasonably priced options we have. What are your thoughts on that?\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: *sighs* Yeah I guess I don't really have another choice, can you switch me over to the earlier flight then? This meeting is really important for my work. \\\\n\\\\nAgent: No problem, I completely understand the need to adjust your travel plans last minute. Let me go ahead and process that change for you. It may take a few minutes to update everything in the system. While I work on that, is there anything else I can help with regarding your itinerary or travel arrangements?\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: No, I think that covers it. Thanks for your help with changing the flight. I appreciate you getting me on that earlier departure.\\\\n\\\\nAgent: You're very welcome, I'm happy I could accommodate the change. Thank you for being understanding about the additional fare. I've gone ahead and sent you an email receipt with your new flight details. Please let me know if any other issues come up before your trip.

Can I get your last name and confirmation number please?\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: Sure, last name is Smith confirmation number is HJF4642.\\\\n\\\\nAgent: Okay, got it here Mr. Smith. What type of change were you looking to make to the flight?\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: Well, something came up at work and I need to fly out on Monday instead of Wednesday. Do you have any seats available on an earlier flight?\\\\n\\\\nAgent: Let me take a look at our flights on Monday. *typing noises* Hmm, it looks like the only flight we have that day leaves at 6am. Would that work with your schedule or do you need a later flight?\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: Ah man, 6am is really early. I was hoping for something in the afternoon. Do you have any flights on Tuesday maybe?\\\\n\\\\nAgent: Umm, let me check Tuesday...it looks like we have a flight leaving at 12:30pm if that works better for you? There are a few seats left.\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: Yeah, that Tuesday flight at 12:30pm would be perfect. How much would it cost to change my flight to that one?\\\\n\\\\nAgent: Okay, just one second while I take a look at the fare difference...alright, it looks like the fare for that flight is going to be an additional $125 plus any difference in bag fees since it's an earlier flight. Does that work for you?\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: Hmm, an extra $125? That's more than I was expecting. Is there any way you could waive the change fee or give me a discount since I'm an loyal customer and have flown United a bunch of times?\\\\n\\\\nAgent: I understand, change fees can really add up. Let me see what I can do for you...*typing* Unfortunately I'm unable to waive the change fee in this case since it's within the week of travel. However, since you fly with us frequently I can offer you a $50 credit that you can put towards your bags or any other charges. Does that help at all?\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: You know, $50 off does help somewhat. Alright, I'll go ahead and change my flight then. Can you process that for me?\\\\n\\\\nAgent: Absolutely, just need to read back the new itinerary details to confirm. Your new flight will be on Tuesday, March 15th leaving Chicago O'Hare at 12:30pm and arriving in San Francisco at 3:25pm. This will be on United flight 495. The additional fare is $125 plus any applicable bag or seat fees. Does this look correct?\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: Yep, that all sounds right. Go ahead and change it for me then.\\\\n\\\\nAgent: Perfect, I've gone ahead and processed the itinerary change for you. You should see the updated reservation in your confirmation email. Thank you for being a loyal United customer, and I hope you have a good rest of your day!\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: Thank you, appreciate your help changing that last minute.

What seems to be the problem sir?\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: Well the problem is that your stupid airline lost my freaking bag! I've been waiting almost a week for it to be delivered and no one can seem to find it. This is unacceptable. \\\\n\\\\nAgent: I understand your frustration sir. Losing a customer's bag is never ideal. Let me take a look here...ah yes, it does show your bag was mishandled during the connection in Detroit. Let me apologize sincerely for that inconvenience. I'll need to get some more details from you to start a trace on the bag's location. Can you verify what color the bag was and any identifying marks?\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: Ugh it was a black Nike duffel bag with a giant Chicago Bears sticker on the side. How hard is it to find a bag like that?! It had all my clothes and toiletries that I needed for my business trip. Now I've had to go out and re-buy everything while your company just loses customers' luggage left and right. This is unacceptable customer service. \\\\n\\\\nAgent: You're right sir, losing luggage is unacceptable. I can guarantee you that we're doing everything we can to find your bag. In the meantime, let me get you set up with a lost baggage reimbursement. *typing noises* Okay, it looks like the maximum we allow for a lost bag is $3,500. Please keep all your receipts for replacement items and we'll process to reimbursed you as soon as your bag is located or declared lost. I'm also adding a $500 credit to your United frequent flyer account for the trouble. Please let me know if there's anything else I can do in the meantime while we work to find your bag.\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: Ugh, whatever. A credit isn't going to fix this inconvenient situation you guys put me in. Just please find my bag as soon as possible so I'm not out any more money, okay? \\\\n\\\\nAgent: You have my word sir, we will do everything we can to get your bag back to you promptly. Is there a phone number I can best reach you at in case we have any updates?\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: Yeah, it's 555-0123. Please call me the second you find anything.

I was supposed to fly from Newark to Denver last Tuesday but my flight got delayed by over 3 hours! I missed my connecting flight and important meeting because of it. \\\\n\\\\nAgent: Hold on one second *typing noises*.. okay I see the issue here. Your flight from Newark did experience a significant delay due to severe weather in the area. I apologize for the inconvenience this caused. Do you have the new itinerary we had you booked on?\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: Umm no actually, when I got to the airport in Denver no one could find my new flight info. I had to buy a last minute ticket on a different airline just to get home that night. And it cost me almost $500!\\\\n\\\\nAgent: I'm terribly sorry to hear that. It seems there was a miscommunication on our end regarding your rebooked itinerary. Let me take a look and see if there's anything I can do to help make this right... *more typing* Unfortunately due to the weather being out of our control we won't be able to provide you with a full refund. However, I'd like to offer you a $250 travel voucher that can be used on any United flights in the next year to help compensate you for the unused ticket and inconvenience. How does that sound?\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: Are you kidding me? That still leaves me $250 in the hole for a problem that was completely your airline's fault! I want the full $500 back that I had to pay to get home. This is ridiculous, you guys really dropped the ball on this one. \\\\n\\\\nAgent: I understand your frustration sir, and I apologize again that we were unable to get you on your connection due to the delays. Unfortunately our weather policy does not allow for full reimbursement. However, let me see if there's anything else I can do for you. *more typing and holding* Okay, I've discussed this with my supervisor and I'm authorized to offer you a full refund of the $500 ticket you purchased instead, as a one-time courtesy due to the multiple issues you experienced. How does that sound?\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: *sigh of relief* Okay, that sounds a little better I guess. When can I expect to see that refund processed?\\\\n\\\\nAgent: I'll go ahead and process the refund for you right now. It should post back to your original form of payment within 5-7 business days. You'll also receive an email confirmation once the refund is completed. Thank you for your patience and for flying with us. I know it was a frustrating experience but I hope this helps make things right. Please feel free to reach back out if you have any other issues.\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: Alright, thanks Daniel.

I'm calling about a flight I booked from Chicago to San Francisco next week. \\\\n\\\\nAgent: No problem, what about the flight were you looking to discuss? *paper shuffling in the background*\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: Well the thing is, something came up and I need to change the date of my return flight. Is there any way I can move it to a couple days later without paying a change fee? I'm really frustrated because this is an important trip and it's going to cost a lot more if I have to pay that fee.\\\\n\\\\nAgent: I understand your frustration sir, let me take a look at your booking. *typing sounds* Okay, it looks like the fare rules for your ticket are non-refundable. Because you're requesting to change the return date within the same week, we would unfortunately have to charge you the change fee, which is $200 plus any fare difference. How firm are you on needing to change that date? Maybe I can take a look at other flights around that time to see if there are any alternatives with better options.\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: Ugh that's what I was afraid of. The thing is, I really need to be back a few days later for a big work meeting. It's going to be a huge problem if I can't make that new date. Is there really no way to waive that fee since this is out of my control? \\\\n\\\\nAgent: *sighs* I completely understand the frustration, unfortunately with the non-refundable fare we have very limited flexibility without fees. Let me check one other thing for you though real quick... *more typing* It looks like we do have one flight leaving three days later that still has open seats in economy. If you're willing to switch over to that flight instead, I may be able to waive the change fee just this once as a one-time courtesy. How does that option sound?\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: You know what, that could actually work. As long as I'm still getting back to Chicago around the same time, I think switching to that later flight would be better than paying $200. I really appreciate you taking a look at that for me.\\\\n\\\\nAgent: No problem at all, I'm happy I could find an alternative that works better for your schedule. Let me go ahead and process that change for you. It will take a few minutes to update so go ahead and have a seat, can I get you anything while you wait - water, coffee?\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: No thanks I'm okay. And thank you, really - I feel a lot better about this trip now.\\\\n\\\\nAgent: You're very welcome. Alright it looks like the change went through successfully.

May I have your confirmation number so I can pull up your reservation?\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: *customer provides confirmation number* Ugh this is so frustrating, I booked this flight months ago and now it's going to mess everything up. \\\\n\\\\nAgent: Let me take a look here...okay I see your flight from Chicago to New York was delayed due to weather. It's now scheduled to leave in about 2 hours. I completely understand your frustration with missing your meeting. One moment let me see what options we can provide to help. *sounds of typing can be heard* It looks like we have a few other flights we can try to get you on today to either JFK or LGA. Unfortunately they are all going to involve a connection but should get you there only a couple hours later than your original flight. How does that sound?\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: A couple hours later is still going to be a problem for this meeting. I needed to be there at noon. Is there any way I can get on a flight sooner? Even if I have to pay more? This delay is going to cost me a big client. \\\\n\\\\nAgent: I understand the importance of making that meeting. Let me check one other thing for you. *more typing sounds* It looks like we do have one nonstop flight leaving for JFK in about an hour that has open seats still. It would be a much faster option than connecting. The only thing is it would be considered a schedule change since it's on a different flight than your original, so there would be a fee of $150 to move you over to that flight. Would that work for you? I know it's more money but it does get you there in time.\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: Ugh $150 is a lot but I guess at this point it's worth it to save the client. Okay yeah let's switch me over to that flight. Can you guys pay for any of this since it's your delay that caused the problem?\\\\n\\\\nAgent: Unfortunately in a situation like a weather delay, the airlines aren't able to provide compensation. I wish there was more I could do there. However, let me go ahead and process that schedule change for you now so you're all set on the new flight. It may take me 10-15 minutes to get that ticket reissued. In the meantime, feel free to grab a snack or beverage on us in the United club while you wait. Again, I sincerely apologize for any inconvenience the delay has caused. Please let me know if there's anything else I can do for you today.\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: Ugh this is ridiculous. Okay well thanks I'll be in the United club. Hopefully this next flight actually leaves on time. \\\\n\\\\nAgent: I'll cross my fingers for you. You should receive an email confirmation of the new itinerary shortly. And please feel free to call back if any other issues come up.

Would it be possible to change my flight to the day before?\\\\n\\\\nAgent: Umm, let me take a look at flights for Wednesday... *more typing* Unfortunately the Wednesday flight from Chicago to Denver is showing up as full. The best I can do is get you on a flight that departs at 3:45pm instead of the morning. I'd need to charge you a $150 change fee to switch you to that flight. Does that work for your schedule or would you prefer to keep your original Thursday flight?\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: Ah man, the afternoon flight won't work with my schedule on Wednesday. I guess I'll just have to stick with Thursday then. Is there any chance I could get a credit for the change fee since the flight wasn't really changed?\\\\n\\\\nAgent: I understand the schedule change is inconvenient.

The weather forecast is saying there may be some storms.\\\\n\\\\nAgent: I understand your concern about the weather. What day is your flight scheduled for? Let me take a look at the forecast and options we may have. \\\\n\\\\nCustomer: It's Friday. Ugh, I really hope it doesn't get canceled, this trip is really important for work. *sound of papers rustling* The forecast said there was a 60% chance of thunderstorms that day.\\\\n\\\\nAgent: Hold on one moment let me pull up that route for Friday. *typing sounds* Okay, looking at the forecast you're right - there is a chance of thunderstorms in both cities that day. As of now the flight is still scheduled to go out. A few days is still a long time out for a weather forecast to change. Let me see what options we have just in case it does get canceled or delayed.\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: *sighs* yeah I know it's still a ways out but I'm a worrier. What can you do?\\\\n\\\\nAgent: I understand the worry, travel delays are always stressful. A few things we can do - first I can put a travel waiver on your booking. That way if the flight does end up canceled or delayed more than 3 hours, you can change your flight at no cost. The other option would be to see about flying out a day earlier on Thursday to give yourself more of a buffer. Let me check rates and availability for that. *more typing sounds* It looks like we do have seats available on Thursday. The fare would be an additional $150 each way. Does flying out a day earlier give you a little more peace of mind?\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: Ugh, $150 more each way is kind of a lot. But you're right, the extra day might give me some peace of mind. And what did you say about being able to change the flight if it gets canceled? \\\\n\\\\nAgent: No problem, I understand last minute flight changes can definitely rack up the costs. With the travel waiver I'll add to your booking, if the Friday flight does end up canceled or delayed by 3 hours or more, you'll be able to reschedule for a different day at no extra cost. You wouldn't have to pay any change fees or fare differences. The waiver should protect you in case of cancellations from the weather.\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: You know, I think I'll just keep my original flight for Friday but add that travel waiver just in case. $150 each way is just more than I want to spend if I don't have to. As long as I can change it no questions asked if something happens, that makes me feel a bit better.\\\\n\\\\nAgent: Absolutely, that's a smart call. Adding the travel waiver gives you protection and flexibility without the extra cost if the original flight works out. Let me go ahead and add that to your booking now. *more typing* Okay, the waiver is all set. If anything comes up with that Friday flight, simply call us or make changes online and you'll be covered.

I'm calling about a flight I booked from Chicago to LA next week.\\\\n\\\\nAgent: No problem, what about the flight were you looking to discuss? \\\\n\\\\nCustomer: Well ahh, I need to change the date of my return flight. The return date I originally booked for is no longer going to work for me. \\\\n\\\\nAgent: I understand, no problem. Let me pull up your reservation and take a look at the options for changing the return date. *typing sounds* Okay, I've got your booking here. What date were you looking to change the return flight to?\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: *sigh* Well the date I had booked was for next Saturday but something came up and I need to fly back on Wednesday instead. Do you have any seats available that day? \\\\n\\\\nAgent: Let me check for Wednesday... *more typing* It looks like we do have seats available to fly back on Wednesday. The good news is there won't be a change fee since you're changing the flight within the same week. However, since Wednesday tends to be a busier travel day, the fare for that flight will be about $50 more than your original return fare. Does that work for your schedule and budget?\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: Umm yeah the extra cost is fine, I just really need to be back earlier than Saturday. Can you go ahead and change my return date to Wednesday then?\\\\n\\\\nAgent: No problem, I'll get that return flight updated for you right now. *typing* Okay, it's all set. Your new return flight from LA to Chicago is now on Wednesday instead of Saturday. You'll receive an email confirmation of the change shortly. Is there anything else I can help with today?\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: No, I think that covers it.

Hopefully there's something similar I can switch to.\\\\n\\\\nAgent: Let me check...okay, it looks like we have seats available on the 10:15am flight from Chicago to Denver next Wednesday. Will that work for your schedule? There will be a $150 change fee to switch to the new date.\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: Hmm, $150 is pretty steep. Is there any way to waive that fee? This change is kind of last minute on my part.\\\\n\\\\nAgent: I understand, fees can certainly add up. Let me take a look here...Unfortunately with it being so close to the original travel date there's not much flexibility. However, given the circumstances, I'll go ahead and credit your account $75 towards future travel as a one-time gesture. Does that work for you?\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: You know, I think I can live with paying $75. That's very nice of you, thank you John! I'll go ahead and switch to that Wednesday flight then.\\\\n\\\\nAgent: Great, I'm happy we could work something out. Let me go ahead and process that change for you.

How can I help you today?\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: Hi Alex, yeah I'm calling about a flight I have coming up next week. Umm, let me pull up my confirmation...(sounds of typing) okay, it's flight 1549 from Chicago to Newark on Tuesday. \\\\n\\\\nAgent: No problem, let me take a look at that flight for you. *typing noises* Okay, I've got the details pulled up. What questions did you have about your trip?\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: Well ah, the thing is - I know the weather's supposed to be bad that day. I was hoping to change my flight to either the day before or after, you know just in case of delays or cancellations. Is there any way to do that without paying a change fee? \\\\n\\\\nAgent: I understand your concern about the weather. Let me take a look at our options for changing your flight date. *more typing* Unfortunately the flights the day before and after are both looking pretty full so there would likely be a higher fare if we moved you to either of those dates. However, since the reason for changing is due to anticipated weather issues rather than just preference, I can waive the change fee for you this one time. Does moving to Monday or Wednesday work best with your schedule?\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: Umm, let me think about that for a second... *pause* You know, Monday might actually be a little tough for me with work. What about if I could just get a refund and rebook for a different airline? Or would there be a fee for that?\\\\n\\\\nAgent: I'm afraid we wouldn't be able to provide a full refund in this case since it's within the normal cancellation window. The best I could offer is a travel voucher for the value of your ticket, minus any applicable fees, that you could use to book future travel on United. There would be no additional fee for canceling and rebooking with the voucher. As for booking with another airline, you'd need to cancel the United reservation completely to get a refund, which would result in losing the value of the ticket. Does the voucher option work for you or would you still prefer to try changing dates?\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: Hmm, yeah I think I'll just go with changing to Wednesday if there's no fee. Not worth the hassle of trying to get a full refund or deal with another airline at this point. As long as the fare and flight times stay about the same that works for me.\\\\n\\\\nAgent: No problem, I've gone ahead and processed the change to Wednesday for you. The fare and flight times will remain the same. Thank you for being understanding about our policies.

My flight from New York to LA is supposed to leave at 2pm but I need to change it to an earlier flight. Is there anything you can do to help?\\\\n\\\\nAgent: Okay, no problem. Let me pull up your booking details. What's the name the reservation is under? \\\\n\\\\nCustomer: It's under John Smith.\\\\n\\\\nAgent: *typing sounds* Alright, I've got your reservation here Mr. Smith. Let me take a look at our earlier flight options for you. *pause as agent checks flight availability* Unfortunately the only other nonstop flight we have leaving New York for LA tomorrow leaves at 10am. Would that work for your schedule?\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: Ugh, 10am is too early. I was hoping for something around noon. There really isn't anything else?\\\\n\\\\nAgent: Let me double check one more time. *more typing* Sorry, the 10am flight is the only nonstop we have that's earlier than your original 2pm flight. We do have some connecting flight options that would get you into LA earlier if you're open to a layover. The best option would be to fly to Chicago first, then connect to a 12:30pm flight from Chicago to LA. Would you like me to try booking that for you?\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: Ah man, I really don't want to have to make a connection. This is so frustrating. I was supposed to have an earlier flight but it got changed on me. Can't you switch me to something direct without me having to pay more?\\\\n\\\\nAgent: I understand your frustration sir, changing flights last minute is never ideal. Unfortunately all our direct flights between New York and LA tomorrow are booked up. I'd be happy to take a look at our fare rules and see if there's any way we can waive the change fee and difference in fare due to the schedule change being on our end. Let me check that for you real quick...*typing and mouse clicking* Okay, after reviewing it looks like because the schedule change was made by United, we will be able to switch you to the 10am direct flight at no additional cost. How does that sound?\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: Ugh, fine I guess I'll take the 10am flight. This is still ridiculous, you guys should really have more options for flights during the day. Thanks for your help I guess.\\\\n\\\\nAgent: You're very welcome, and I apologize again for the inconvenience. I'll go ahead and process that flight change for you now.

I've been checking the weather reports and it looks like there's a strong chance of snow storms during my travel dates. I'm a bit worried my flights could get canceled or delayed.\\\\n\\\\nAgent: No problem, I can understand your concern about potential weather issues. Let me pull up your reservation and take a look. What are the dates of your travel?\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: The flight to London is scheduled to leave O'Hare next Wednesday, and I'll be returning from Heathrow the following Wednesday. January 15th and 22nd.\\\\n\\\\nAgent: Okay, let me take a look here... *typing noises* Yep, I see your flights booked between Chicago and London on those dates. The forecasts do show a possibility of some winter weather moving through the Midwest and Northeast next week. United does have rebooking policies in place for flights impacted by things outside of our control like weather. Why don't I go over the options we have available just in case there are any cancellations or significant delays? I can also send you some travel alerts to your phone with updated flight status. How does that sound?\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: That would be great, thanks David. I'm just worried because it's an international trip and there's a lot riding on making those connections. What options would I have if the flights get canceled or delayed a lot?\\\\n\\\\nAgent: No problem, I completely understand the concern with international travel. Okay, so if your inbound or outbound flights are canceled due to weather, here are the options United's rebooking policy provides:\\\\n\\\\nWe'll first try to rebook you on the next available United flight heading to/from your destination within the next 24 hours. If there's nothing available sooner, we can rebook you up to 7 days later. You'd fly out on the same dates if possible, but may have to shift to the following week if needed.\\\\n\\\\nIn the event of multiple cancellations or significant delays, you also have the option to receive a full refund without any cancellation fees. We can process the refund for you today even though your travel dates are a few weeks away. You'd then be able to rebook directly through United or another carrier as flight schedules open back up. \\\\n\\\\nThe last option is we could try rerouting you through a different United hub like Newark, Dulles, or Denver if they may have better weather and flight availability.\\\\n\\\\nDoes this help summarize the options? Let me know if any of those work best for your travel needs or if you have any other questions!\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: That all makes sense, thanks for explaining the options clearly. I think for peace of mind, it might be best to go ahead and get the refund processed now instead of waiting and seeing if the flights get canceled. That way if the weather does end up grounding planes, I'm not stranded somewhere. Could you go ahead and refund my tickets?\\\\n\\\\nAgent: Absolutely, I think refunding the tickets proactively is a smart choice given the weather uncertainty. One moment while I process that for you... *more typing noises* Alright, the refund has been completed. You should see the original form of payment credited back within the next 7-10 business days. Please let me know once you've received the refund posting. Are there any other questions I can answer for you before we finish up?\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: No, I think that covers everything I needed. Thank you so much for your help David, I really appreciate you taking the time to explain all the options clearly. It makes me feel a lot better walking away with a refund in hand just in case.\\\\n\\\\nAgent: You're very welcome, I'm glad I could provide some reassurance during what can be a stressful travel time.

What is your question about it?\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: Well, I just found out I have an important meeting in New York on Monday that I have to be there for. The arrival time for my flight is 7:45pm on Friday, which doesn't give me much time before the weekend. I was wondering if there was any way I could change my flight to an earlier one that day?\\\\n\\\\nAgent: Umm, let me take a look at our earlier flight options for that route on Friday. *more keyboard clicking* It looks like we have a flight that leaves at 3pm that would get you into New York at 6:15pm. That flight isn't fully booked yet so I should be able to transfer your ticket over to that one. The only potential issue is that it would be a difference of $75 in fare since that flight is pricier. Would that work for you?\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: Yeah, that earlier flight would work much better for me. Hmm, $75 is a bit more than I was wanting to pay. Would there be any other options like maybe getting credit to use for a future flight or something instead of paying the difference?\\\\n\\\\nAgent: Let me see... *typing sounds* Unfortunately because it's within a week of your travel there wouldn't be any non-refundable credit options. I could potentially offer you a $50 voucher that would be good for travel within the next 6 months as an incentive to switch to the earlier flight, but that would still leave a $25 balance. Would you be able to pay that or are you really just trying to avoid any additional costs?\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: Umm, you know what... the $25 isn't a huge deal. I think I'll go ahead and switch to the earlier flight and pay the $25. I'd really appreciate that $50 voucher too. This will work out a lot better for my schedule next week.\\\\n\\\\nAgent: Okay, great! I'm just going to process the flight change for you now. *typing and clicking sounds* Alright, you're all set on the 3pm flight. The $25 difference will be charged to the card we have on file.

I'll do my best to help resolve your concerns.\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: Well first of all, our flight was delayed by over 3 hours for no good reason. We sat on the tarmac forever with no information. Then when we finally took off, it felt like the plane was going to fall apart! The turbulence was insane. \\\\n\\\\nAgent: I apologize for the significant delay, those are never ideal. Was there any communication from the crew about why the delay occurred? As for the turbulence, unfortunately that's something that can't always be anticipated or avoided. But I understand how unsettling that must have been.\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: They said it was due to maintenance issues but they wouldn't give us any real details. And the turbulence was no normal turbulence, I'm still feeling rattled just thinking about it. But then to make matters worse, when we landed they lost my luggage! I still haven't gotten it back and I need things from my bag. \\\\n\\\\nAgent: That is unacceptable, sir. Let me take a closer look at what happened with your bag. *typing noises* According to the records, it looks like your luggage was misrouted and arrived a day later than your flight did. Our customer service team should have contacted you directly about the delay. I do see your bag was delivered but clearly the experience of being without your items for even a night is inconvenient. As compensation, I'd like to offer you a $500 travel voucher for future United flights. Will that help make up for some of the difficulties you endured?\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: I mean, I guess that helps a little but it doesn't make up for the terrible flight. You guys really dropped the ball on this one. Can you do anything else?\\\\n\\\\nAgent: You're right, sir, the whole experience does seem unacceptably poor. Let me check a few other options for you. Hmm, given this was such a long haul flight, would you accept a roundtrip ticket in the continental US, along with the $500 voucher? That should help give you a positive experience to make up for this one. And of course feel free to contact me directly if any other issues come up down the line.\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: *sighs* you know, I think I'd feel better if I also got some miles or something too. This really left a bad taste in my mouth about flying United. \\\\n\\\\nAgent: You make a fair point. Alright, on top of the roundtrip ticket and voucher, let me also add 50,000 frequent flyer miles to your United account. I'm hoping these compensation offers show our commitment to making this right. Pleaseaccept our apologies again for falling short and causing you unnecessary stress during your travels.\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: You know, I'm still not thrilled but I guess that'll have to do.

What's the name the flight is booked under?\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: It's booked under John Smith. The flight is this Saturday, May 15th from Chicago to Denver, flight number 1988. \\\\n\\\\nAgent: Okay, let me pull that up...*typing noises* alright I've got your reservation here John. What was the change you needed to make?\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: Well like I said, something came up and I need to move the flight to next Saturday, May 22nd. The return flight was for the following Wednesday but I'll need to change that date too now. \\\\n\\\\nAgent: I understand, Saturday schedules do sometimes need adjusting. Let me check availability for next Saturday...*more typing* It looks like we do have seats available on a flight leaving Chicago at 11:35am and arriving in Denver at 1:20pm, would that work? For the return date, I'm showing availability to fly back on the following Wednesday, May 26th, would that be good?\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: Yeah, those dates should work. What will this cost me to change the flights?\\\\n\\\\nAgent: Let me take a look at the fare rules for your ticket...*typing noises* Okay, since this is within the 7 day window prior to departure it would be a $150 fee per ticket to make the change. However, since you booked directly with us instead of a third party we can waive one of those fees for you. So the total to move both flights would be $150. Does that work for you?\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: Hmm, yeah I guess $150 is better than having to buy new tickets. Alright, go ahead and change them to those dates please.\\\\n\\\\nAgent: No problem, I've gone ahead and processed the changes for you. You'll receive an email confirmation shortly.

What questions did you have about it?\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: Well, ahh I was hoping to change the time of the flight. The one I'm booked on right now leaves pretty early, at 6am, and I was wondering if there was a later flight available that day?\\\\n\\\\nAgent: No problem, let me check the schedule for later flights from Chicago to LA that day. *more typing* It looks like the only other non-stop option leaving Chicago that day departs at 2pm. Would moving to that flight work better for your travel plans?\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: Yeah, the 2pm flight would be much better. Is there any chance I could switch to that one without paying a change fee? I know it's only a couple weeks out.\\\\n\\\\nAgent: Unfortunately because it's within the two week period before travel, there would be a $200 change fee to switch you to the later flight. However, given that you're an Executive Platinum member who flies with us frequently, I'd be happy to waive that fee as a one-time courtesy. Let me go ahead and process the change for you.\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: Ah wow, thank you so much Adam I really appreciate you waiving that fee.

Would you like me to go ahead and switch you over to that flight? There will be a change fee of $150 since it's within the 7 day period.\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: Ugh $150, that's pretty steep. Do you have any other options that might be cheaper? I'm pretty flexible on dates.\\\\n\\\\nAgent: Let me take a look at some other date options for you. Hmm, it looks like Tuesday afternoon at 3:05pm has open seats and the change fee would only be $50 for that one since it's further out. Or if you're willing to wait until the following Saturday, that change would be fee-free. How does one of those options work for you?\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: You know, I think I'll just go with the Tuesday flight. $50 is more reasonable than $150. Can you switch me over to that?\\\\n\\\\nAgent: Sure, let me process that change for you. *typing and clicking noises* Okay, I've got you booked on the Tuesday flight now.

My flight from Boston to LA keeps getting delayed. It's been delayed three times already! I'm getting really stressed about missing my meeting out in LA. \\\\n\\\\nAgent: I understand your frustration sir. Delays are never easy especially when you have plans. Let me take a look at your reservation and see what I can find out about the status of your flight. What's the confirmation number?\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: It's UA123546. Please tell me you have an earlier flight I can get on to get there on time. I really don't want to miss this meeting.\\\\n\\\\nAgent: *typing noises* Okay, let me see...hmm it looks like your flight is currently scheduled to depart at 6pm tomorrow evening. The latest delay was due to mechanical issues but it looks like they're hoping to have the plane repaired in time for your departure. Unfortunately, all the earlier flights for tomorrow are fully booked. Let me check if there's any standby or upgrade options available for you...*more typing* it doesn't look promis-\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: Are you kidding me?! This is ridiculous. Three delays and now no earlier flights? What am I supposed to do, miss my meeting? I need to be in LA by noon tomorrow. \\\\n\\\\nAgent: I understand your frustration sir. One moment let me see if there's any other options...*typing rapidly* It looks like we do have one possibility. There is one seat available on an 8am flight from Boston to LAX with a connection in Denver. You'd have to fly into Denver and then connect to a 10:30am flight into LAX. You would land in LAX by 11:15am. It is going to be more expensive since this is a last minute change but it would get you there on time. Would you like me to book you on that itinerary?\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: Ugh, yeah I guess that'll have to work. Please book me on that. How much more is it going to be? \\\\n\\\\nAgent: Just one second while I process the change...okay the additional cost for the itinerary change would be $450. Does that work for you? I know it's not ideal with the additional cost but it will for sure get you there on time.\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: $450?! You've got to be kidding me. This is ridiculous. Three delays caused by you guys and now you're going to charge me almost $500 to get me there on time. \\\\n\\\\nAgent: I completely understand your frustration sir. The additional cost is certainly not ideal. Let me see if there's anything I can do to help offset it. *types in system for a few moments* Unfortunately, given that this is a same-day change being processed, our policies don't allow me to waive the change fee. However, I'm able to provide you with a $150 credit that can be used on any United flight within the next year to help make the cost a little more manageable. In addition, I'll make sure to note your account about the multiple delays so customer relations can also potentially provide additional compensation. Given the situation, is the revised cost of $300 plus the $150 credit acceptable to get you booked on the earlier itinerary?\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: *long sigh* I guess that'll have to do. Yeah okay, go ahead and book me then. This has been a huge headache, you guys really dropped the ball here. \\\\n\\\\nAgent: I understand your frustration and really appreciate your patience through all of this. Just one moment while I process the itinerary change and credit for you...okay sir, you are all set on the 8am flight leaving Boston and connecting through Denver to LAX.

This is really inconvenient for me, is there anything you can do?\\\\n\\\\nAgent: I understand this delay must be frustrating for your travel plans. Let me take a look at your reservation. What's the name the ticket is booked under? \\\\n\\\\nCustomer: It's booked under John Smith. \\\\n\\\\nAgent: Okay, let me pull up your reservation. *typing noises* Alright, I see here your flight from Chicago to New York was rescheduled to depart at 7:05pm tomorrow due to forecasted snow in Chicago. Umm, let me take a look at our flight options to see if we can get you out earlier. *more typing* Unfortunately it looks like all the earlier flights are fully booked. However, since this was a flight delay caused by our weather, I can offer you a $200 travel credit that you can use for future bookings. How does that sound?\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: A $200 credit isn't really helpful for getting me to New York on time tomorrow though. All the rental cars are booked for tomorrow too. Is there any earlier flight I can take, even if I have to drive to a different airport or pay more? This delay is gonna make me miss something really important.\\\\n\\\\nAgent: Ah shoot, I understand the delay is really putting you in a bind. Let me check a few other options for you. Hmm, it looks like there is one seat left on a 5:30pm flight out of Midway instead of O'Hare. It would involve a 1 hour drive for you to Midway airport but would get you into New York over 2 hours earlier. I can transfer your booking to that flight but you would need to pay the $150 fare difference. Would that work better for your travel plans? I know it's not ideal to have to switch airports last minute but it's the only earlier option I can see.\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: Ugh yeah I guess that'll have to work then. Okay, go ahead and switch me over to that Midway flight. *sighs heavily* This is so frustrating, your delays always seem to happen to me. Can you do anything else to help since I'll have to deal with the extra drive and hassle?\\\\n\\\\nAgent: I completely understand your frustration, sir. Weather delays are certainly out of our control but I can see how last-minute changes make travel stressful. Let me go ahead and process that flight change for you and I'll also add a $50 voucher to cover part of your extra driving and parking costs. I'll also mention your account to my supervisor - we may be able to provide you with priority boarding or a travel voucher for future use as a courtesy for multiple delays. How does that sound as a resolution for today? I'm happy to keep exploring options if you're still not fully satisfied.\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: You know what, that all helps. Thanks for your help getting me on that earlier flight and the other credits. I really appreciate you taking the time to help work it all out.\\\\n\\\\nAgent: You're very welcome, I'm glad we were able to find a solution that works better for your travel needs.

What was the reason for the date change?\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: Umm, a work thing came up and my meeting got pushed back a day. So I need to travel a day later now.\\\\n\\\\nAgent: No problem, I understand how travel plans can change. Let me check availability for next Friday... *more typing* It looks like there is still space on that flight. The good news is we can process a one-time date change for you free of charge since you're altering the plans more than a week before departure. I'll go ahead and update the reservation with the new travel date.\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: Ah okay, great! Thank you so much for helping with that.\\\\n\\\\nAgent: You're very welcome! Just one moment while I finish processing this change...okay, all set. Your new flight is now booked for next Friday leaving Chicago and arriving in London. Is there anything else I can help with today?\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: No I think that covers it, thanks so much for your help Alex!\\\\n\\\\nAgent: You're very welcome, I'm glad we could get that changed for you.

There was a big snowstorm that rolled through a couple hours ago and the runway had to be plowed. Rather than cancel the flight altogether, we decided to delay it until the runway could be cleared for safe landings. I know it's inconvenient, but safety has to come first.\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: Ugh this is ridiculous, how am I supposed to get home now? All the last minute flights are super expensive and tomorrow is a work day. You guys need to do something to compensate me for this. \\\\n\\\\nAgent: You're right, this is definitely an inconvenience for you. Let me see what I can do to help make this up. *more typing* Due to the significant delay, I'm going to go ahead and refund your ticket. You can then book another flight tomorrow at a time that works better for you. I'll also give you a $300 voucher to put towards that new ticket since last minute flights tend to cost more.

This better not happen when I fly back on Sunday or there will be hell to pay, you got it? \\\\n\\\\nAgent: I understand your frustration sir, and I appreciate your business.

How much would it cost to change it to that new flight?\\\\n\\\\nAgent: *more typing* Alright, since you're changing your flight within the same fare rules, there shouldn't be a change fee. However, since this new flight is in a higher fare class, there would be a $75 increase in price per ticket.

Is there any chance of getting on an later flight that day for the same price as my original ticket?\\\\n\\\\nAgent: Let me check some other flight options...it looks like we do have availability on a flight leaving Denver at 11:15am that would get you into Chicago by 1:30pm.

The whole experience was just terrible. \\\\n\\\\nAgent: I'm sorry to hear you had a bad experience. What seemed to be the issue?\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: Well first of all, my flight was delayed by over 3 hours with no explanation given. I was stuck at the airport forever just waiting around. Then when we finally took off, the plane felt like it was falling apart. The air conditioning didn't work so it was boiling hot the whole time. And to top it all off, my bag was lost and it's still not been delivered to me a week later. \\\\n\\\\nAgent: Ah man, that does sound like a really frustrating experience. *pause* Airport delays are never fun, but over 3 hours is definitely excessive. As for the plane issues, I apologize that the air conditioning wasn't working properly - that's not the comfortable flight anyone wants. And losing your bag is just the icing on the cake at that point. Let me take a look into all of this for you and see what compensation we can offer to make up for the trouble. Can I get your confirmation code or last name to pull up your record?\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: It's Smith, John Smith. Flight was from Chicago to San Francisco last Thursday.\\\\n\\\\nAgent: Okay, let me pull that up... *typing noises* Yep, here is your reservation Mr. Smith. I'm seeing the flight was delayed due to maintenance issues with the aircraft. We definitely should have communicated that better to passengers. As for the air conditioning, I'll make note of the issue in case there were any mechanical problems there. And it looks like your bag is still showing as missing - I'll put a priority trace on it to find out what happened. In the meantime, please know that we will reimburse you for any essential items you had to purchase while waiting for your bag to arrive. I'd also like to offer you a $500 travel voucher for your next United flight to compensate for the poor experience. How does that sound?\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: I mean, I guess that voucher helps a little bit but you guys really ruined my trip. $500 doesn't really make up for everything I went through. Is there any way you can do better than that?  \\\\n\\\\nAgent: Umm, you make a fair point. Let me check what additional options I might have to improve the compensation. *typing* It looks like for a situation like this involving multiple issues, I am authorized to offer up to a $1000 travel certificate. Would that be more acceptable to you? I know it doesn't undo the bad experience, but hopefully it shows our commitment to taking care of customers in these types of situations.\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: *sighs* Yeah, I suppose $1000 is better than nothing. It's just so frustrating because this was supposed to be a fun vacation and instead it was a total nightmare from start to finish. I don't even want to fly United again after this.\\\\n\\\\nAgent: I completely understand your frustration, and I don't blame you for feeling that way at all. We really aim to provide a pleasant and stress-free travel experience, so it's unacceptable when things go so wrong. I'll be sure to document all the issues you reported so our operations and customer relations teams can thoroughly look into what happened. Hopefully we can use this feedback to improve and prevent similar situations going forward. And please, if there's any other way I can assist you today - even just listening - I'm here to help. Customer satisfaction is very important to me.\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: All right, well I think $1000 helps make up for some of it at least.

This came up kinda last minute for me. \\\\n\\\\nAgent: I understand, fees are never fun. Let me take a look here...it looks like based on the reason for your change, which is personal, I unfortunately can't waive the fee for you this time. We usually only waive it for work or medical related changes. But maybe there's another option - would you consider flying out on Monday and returning on Saturday instead?

This really bites though, makes me not want to fly United again. Can you just go ahead and switch me over to it?\\\\n\\\\nAgent: I understand your frustration sir. Let me get that booked for you on Delta right now. *more keyboard clicks* Okay, you're all set on flight 4532 with Delta leaving Wednesday at 10:05am arriving at 1:55pm. The $100 voucher has been added to your United account. Thank you for flying with us and I apologize again for any inconvenience caused by the schedule change.

I wanted to check if there have been any changes to the schedule.\\\\n\\\\nAgent: No problem, can I please have your confirmation number so I can look up your booking? \\\\n\\\\nCustomer: Sure, let me grab that...it's PX456213. \\\\n\\\\nAgent: Okay, just giving that a look...alright, I've pulled up your booking. Your flight is still scheduled to depart New York JFK at 6pm and arrive in LAX at 9:15pm next Wednesday. Have you received any notifications about any delays or cancellations?\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: No, I haven't received any emails or anything. I just wanted to double check because the weather forecasts are saying there could be some storms next week.\\\\n\\\\nAgent: Yeah, it does look like there is a chance of some rain and thunderstorms in the northeast next Wednesday. Let me check if there are any potential impacts to your flight...ahh it looks like as of now everything is still on schedule to depart as planned. Of course, things could change in the coming days if the storms look stronger. I'd recommend checking your email and the United app in the next few days for any updates. We'll also try to contact you directly if any changes are made. Beyond that, I'd just confirm at the airport as your scheduled departure time approaches. Does that help put your mind at ease for now?\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: Yeah, that's helpful. I'll be sure to keep an eye out for any updates in the next few days leading up to the flight. Umm, do you know if the weather is supposed to impact any of the connecting flights from LAX to Seattle that evening?\\\\n\\\\nAgent: Let me check on connecting flight options for you...Okay, looking at flights from LAX to Seattle that evening, it doesn't appear the weather systems moving through will impact that route. Flights from LA to Seattle are primarily heading north, while the storms look to be tracking east. The forecast has some light rain possible in Seattle but no major delays predicted at this time. Of course, if your NY to LA flight is delayed, that could potentially cause you to miss your connection. But based on the current schedule, it looks like you should have no issues flying into LA then onward to Seattle that night. Does that help or is there anything else I can look into for you today?\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: No, that covers everything I needed to check on. Thank you so much for taking the time to look into this and help put my mind at ease.

This trip is coming up fast!\\\\n\\\\nAgent: Okay Mr. Smith, I've got your itinerary pulled up. What did you need to change on the reservation?\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: Well, ahh I was hoping to change the return flight from London to Chicago. The current flight lands really late, like midnight, and I have an early meeting the next day. Any chance there's an earlier return flight available? \\\\n\\\\nAgent: Let me take a look at flight options for that date. *typing noises* It looks like the only other flight that day leaves London at 4pm, would arriving in Chicago at 6pm work better for your schedule?\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: Yeah 6pm would be much better, that gives me time to get home and rest before the meeting. Umm, what would I need to pay to switch to that flight? I know usually there's a change fee.\\\\n\\\\nAgent: Given that your original flight time is quite late, I'll waive the change fee just this once. To switch you to the 4pm flight will be an additional $100 difference in fare. Does that work for your budget?\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: Phew, that's not too bad then. Okay, yeah let's switch me over to that 4pm return flight then. I really appreciate you waiving the change fee, that meeting is really important so this helps a lot.\\\\n\\\\nAgent: No problem, I'm happy I could help accommodate your schedule change. I've gone ahead and updated your reservation now. Your new itinerary and flight details will be in the email confirmation I'm sending you right now.

No one would tell us anything! \\\\n\\\\nAgent: Okay let me pull up your reservation...*typing noises*...ah yes, here it is Mr. Jackson. It looks like your flight was delayed due to severe weather in Chicago. There were high winds that prevented flights from taking off safely. The pilots needed to wait for the winds to die down before it was safe to fly. I know delays are frustrating, especially with no communication. We should have kept passengers updated on the situation.\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: Well it ruined our whole evening! We missed dinner plans with friends. Is there any kind of compensation you can offer for the trouble? Three hours is a really long delay.\\\\n\\\\nAgent: You're absolutely right, a three hour delay is significant. Let me see what I can do for you...*more typing*...as an apology for the delay and lack of communication, I'd like to offer you a $300 travel credit that can be used for future flights on United. Will that work for you?\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: I guess $300 is better than nothing. But I better not have any other problems if I book another flight with you guys. *long sigh* Alright, thanks I appreciate the credit. Just please do a better job updating passengers during delays next time.\\\\n\\\\nAgent: You have my word we'll work on providing timely updates.

Let me take a look here and see if there's anything I can do... *typing* Unfortunately since it's within the 7 day window, the change fee is non-waivable. However, if you wanted to keep your existing reservation for a future travel credit, I can offer to fully refund your tickets minus the $150 fee per passenger to put toward future travel. Would that be an option?\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: Hmm, that might work. How long would I have to use the credit?\\\\n\\\\nAgent: The travel credit would be good for one year from the original travel date. So you'd need to book and travel by this time next year. All you'd pay is any difference in fare. Does that sound doable?\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: Yeah, I think that'll work for me then.

It looks like that route is pretty busy on Saturdays, give me just a moment to check availability. *more typing* Hmm, it's looking a bit limited but I may have found an option for you. How does leaving at 1:15pm on Saturday work? We'd have to switch you to a partner airline but it would still get you to Denver that day.\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: Ugh, I was hoping for later in the day on Saturday. What other options are there? This is so frustrating, the website never works right. \\\\n\\\\nAgent: I understand the frustration sir. Websites do tend to glitch from time to time. Let me see if I have any other options that leave later...*typing* unfortunately that 1:15pm flight is really the only Saturday flight available in the same fare class as your original ticket. I could put you on the 4:45pm flight instead but it would be a higher fare. Would that work for you or are you set on leaving later than that?\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: How much more is the later flight? I really need to leave by 6pm at the latest. This is ridiculous, your website shouldn't be this difficult to use. \\\\n\\\\nAgent: You're right, the website experience could definitely be better. One moment while I check the fare difference...okay, changing you to the 6:05pm United flight on Saturday would be an additional $150 per ticket. I know that's a significant price jump. Let me see if there's any wiggle room I have on my end to help offset that cost a bit. *more typing and clicking* Hmm...the best I can do is give you a $75 credit to put towards the higher fare. I'm afraid that's the best option I have available that gets you to Denver by 6pm on Saturday. What are your thoughts on that?\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: Ugh, fine I'll take it I guess. This has just been a huge pain. Make the change to the 6:05pm flight on Saturday and apply the $75 credit. Can you also give me my confirmation number? I want to get off this phone as fast as possible.\\\\n\\\\nAgent: I completely understand your frustration sir, and I appreciate your patience as we worked to find a solution. I've gone ahead and processed the change, applying the $75 credit to bring your new total to $75 more than your original fare. Your new confirmation number is GRET5693. Please let me know if you have any other issues, but it looks like you're all set for your Saturday flight now. Thank you for flying United and I hope the rest of your trip goes smoothly.\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: Yeah, thanks. *hangs up*\\\\n\\\\nAgent: You're very welcome. Thank you for calling United Airlines, have a good rest of your day. *hangs up*\\\\n\\\\nHow's that? I took into account the call duration of 155 seconds, attempted to hit the target word count of 5840 words, incorporated the customer's negative sentiment and frustration, and tried to make the agent remain calm and diplomatic while resolving the issue.

Is there any way I can change my flight to an earlier date? \\\\n\\\\nAgent: Let me pull up your reservation and take a look. What's the name the booking is under?\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: John Smith. \\\\n\\\\nAgent: Okay, got it. It looks like the flight you booked on Wednesday is currently full on Monday. Let me check some other flight options for you on that day. *typing noises* Hmm, it looks like the next available flight leaving Chicago for San Francisco on Monday leaves at 11:35am. Would that work with your new schedule?\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: Ah man, that time doesn't really work for me since I'd have to be at the job orientation that afternoon. Are there any other options maybe for a later flight that day or one on Tuesday? \\\\n\\\\nAgent: No problem, let me see what I can find. *more typing* It seems like the next flight after 11:35 on Monday leaves around 5:00pm, would that work better for your schedule? Or I'm also seeing some availability on Tuesday morning around 9:30am if you could fly out then instead.\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: What would it cost to change my flight to one of those other dates? The Wednesday flight I booked was like $300 roundtrip.\\\\n\\\\nAgent: Let me check the fare difference for you...Okay, so switching to that 5pm flight on Monday would be an additional $75 fee since it's an itinerary change within a week of travel. And changing to the Tuesday morning flight would be a $50 fee. So the Monday flight would be around $375 total and Tuesday around $350. Do either of those work with your new plans and budget?\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: Ugh yeah those change fees are pretty steep. What if I were to just cancel the Wednesday flight and rebook one of those other dates instead? Would that be cheaper? \\\\n\\\\nAgent: Good thought. Let me take a look at canceling and rebooking...You're right, that would actually be cheaper. If we were to go ahead and cancel the Wednesday flight, I'm seeing the Monday 5pm flight is currently priced around $250 roundtrip if you book it now. And the Tuesday morning flight is showing as $230. So in both cases it would save you money versus paying the change fees. Does one of those flights work best for your schedule?\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: Okay yeah let's go ahead and cancel the Wednesday one then and book me on that Monday flight at 5pm. I appreciate you taking the time to find me a better option, those change fees are no joke!\\\\n\\\\nAgent: No problem, I'm happy I could help find a more affordable solution for you. Okay, I've gone ahead and canceled the Wednesday flight and have rebooked you on the Monday departure leaving at 5pm. You're all set with that new itinerary. Let me know if you need a confirmation email as well. And thank you for flying with United, I hope you have a good rest of your day!\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: Thank you so much for your help, really appreciate you working with me on this.

Umm, let me pull up my reservation... *sounds of typing* Okay, I have a flight from Chicago to London next Friday but I need to change it to the following week. Is that possible?\\\\n\\\\nAgent: No problem, let me take a look at your reservation details and see what options are available for changing your flight. *typing noises* Okay, I've pulled up your reservation for the flight from Chicago to London departing next Friday. Unfortunately that flight is pretty full for next week as well, but I do see there is still availability on the same flight the following Wednesday. Would moving your departure date to then work for your travel plans?\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: Hmm, Wednesday wouldn't actually work unfortunately since I have meetings scheduled for that whole week in London. Ah shoot, is there any other option you could see maybe? I'm really hoping to keep the same day of the week if possible, just push it back one week.\\\\n\\\\nAgent: Let me check a few other possibilities for you then. *more typing* It does look pretty tight for the exact same day of the week one week later. That original flight and the following week's flight are both close to full. However, I do see there is still space available if you switched to the Monday of the second week instead, departing Chicago that day. Would flying out on Monday work instead of Friday? I know it's not ideal to change days but it would at least keep you within the same general week.\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: Yeah Monday would still work, that's better than Wednesday for sure. What would the change fee be to switch it to that Monday flight? I'm hoping it's not too expensive since this change is really last minute.\\\\n\\\\nAgent: No problem, let me take a look at the rebooking fee for changing your flight to that Monday... *more typing* Okay, since this change is being made within the standard cancel/change window for your ticket, the fee to switch you over to that Monday flight would be $150. Does that fee work for your situation? I know last minute changes usually come with a cost but hopefully $150 is reasonable given you need to make an adjustment.\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: Hmm $150 is a bit more than I was hoping to pay. Is there any wiggle room on that fee at all? I'm a pretty frequent flyer with United so maybe there's a way to get it down just a tad? I'd hate to lose my whole booking over $50 or so. \\\\n\\\\nAgent: You know, as a loyal frequent flyer I may be able to offer a small courtesy credit to help offset part of that change fee for you. Let me see what I can do... *even more typing sounds* Okay, I've applied a $50 credit to your frequent flyer account which should reduce the change fee down to $100 even. How does that sound? I hope making the adjustment a bit more affordable will help you keep your existing booking and get to your destination on time.\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: Wow, thank you so much David - $100 is absolutely doable. I really appreciate you taking the time to help me out and find a solution. You've definitely saved my trip!\\\\n\\\\nAgent: You're very welcome, I'm glad I could help get your travel plans back on track. I'll go ahead and process that flight change for you right now.

If not, they'll declare it lost and you can submit receipts for any essential items purchased while waiting for compensation. Does that help explain the process?\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: Yes, that's really helpful to know. I'm hoping they find it of course but it's good to know what to expect if not. Thank you for checking on that for me!\\\\n\\\\nAgent: You're very welcome, I'm glad I could provide some clarity on the claim process.

What seems to be the issue you're having with the flight?\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: Well the problem is, when I originally booked this flight a few months ago it said it would depart at 10am. But now when I log into my account, it's saying the departure time is 8am. That's two hours earlier than what I signed up for. I can't leave that early, it's really going to mess things up. \\\\n\\\\nAgent: I apologize for any confusion regarding the departure time change. *more typing* It looks like we had to adjust some of our flight times on that route a few weeks ago due to scheduling issues. Unfortunately we don't offer refunds for minor itinerary changes like departure time adjustments of less than three hours. However, I'd be happy to take a look at alternatives that could possibly work better for your schedule. Do you have any other days you'd be able to fly out?\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: Ugh, are you serious? You guys just change the flight times whenever you feel like it with no warning? That's ridiculous. *sighs loudly* I can't change my date, this was the only day I could take off of work for this trip. Is there any way you can switch me back to the original 10am time or give me a credit of some kind since you messed up my plans?\\\\n\\\\nAgent: I understand your frustration with the change, that is less than ideal. Let me check a few things and see if there are any options. *more typing and clicking sounds* Unfortunately that specific 10am flight is now fully booked so I can't switch you back to that departure. However, since this was an airline-initiated change with short notice given, I'd be happy to offer you a $100 travel voucher that could be used on this or a future booking as a one-time courtesy. Will that work for you?\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: Ah man, I really was hoping to just get my original departure time back. But I guess a $100 credit is better than nothing since you guys screwed this up. Alright, fine - I'll take the voucher. But I better get an email with the details of that soon. This really put a wrench in my plans!!\\\\n\\\\nAgent: I completely understand, and I apologize again for any inconvenience caused by the departure time adjustment.

I'll be checking one bag - do you have the fee for that?\\\\n\\\\nAgent: No problem. For your itinerary, the first checked bag fee would be $30 each way. So checking one bag on your flight from Chicago to San Francisco would be a $30 fee. Additional bags above that one would cost more. Does that help?\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: Yeah, that's helpful to know.

The best option I see is moving you to a flight on July 15th, returning from London and arriving in Chicago at 5:50pm. How does that date work for you?\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: Yeah July 15th could work. What would the cost be to change it to that date? I saw online there was a fee for any changes..\\\\n\\\\nAgent: You're right, there is a change fee since it's within the final payment period. The fee would be $150 plus any difference in fare. Let me check the fare for July 15th. *more typing* Alright, it looks like the fare for that return flight is actually $50 more than your original booking. So the total to change it would be the $150 fee plus the $50 difference in fare, making the total $200. Does that work for you?\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: Hmm, $200 does seem like a lot. Is there any way you could potentially waive the fee since it's only a one week difference? Sorry, just trying to save some money if possible. \\\\n\\\\nAgent: I understand, flight change fees can really add up. Let me see if there's any wiggle room on waiving the fee since it is just a small date change. *puts call on hold for a couple minutes* I was able to talk to my supervisor and they've agreed to waive the $150 change fee just this once, since you've been a loyal customer. So the only cost would be the $50 difference in fare. Does July 15th work with just paying the $50?\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: Oh wow, thank you so much for doing that! I really appreciate you helping me out. And yes, July 15th with just the $50 difference is perfect. You've made my day!\\\\n\\\\nAgent: You're very welcome, I'm happy I could help.

How may I help you today?\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: Hi Alex, yeah I'm calling about a flight I booked from Chicago to Denver next Wednesday. Umm, I think there was a change to the schedule but I'm not sure. \\\\n\\\\nAgent: Okay, no problem. Can I get your confirmation number so I can pull up your reservation?\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: Yeah, let me find that... *sounds of papers rustling* Okay, here it is - C45G21. \\\\n\\\\nAgent: Thanks, just one second while I take a look... *typing noises* Okay, I've found your reservation. It looks like your flight from Chicago to Denver was changed from the schedule you originally booked. The new departure time is at 11:15am instead of 9:45am. \\\\n\\\\nCustomer: Ah man, that's no good. 11:15 doesn't work for the meeting I've got to make in Denver. Is there any way to change it back to the original time?\\\\n\\\\nAgent: Let me check on that for you. *more typing* Unfortunately that earlier flight is now fully booked so we don't have any seats available to switch you back. However, I do see we have some availability on an even earlier flight departing at 8:30am instead, if that could work for your schedule?\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: Hmm, 8:30 might work actually. What would the cost be to change to that flight?\\\\n\\\\nAgent: Just one moment... *typing noises continue* Okay, it looks like the change fee for switching your flight would be $100 plus any difference in fare. The fare for the 8:30am flight is $25 higher than what you already paid. So the total to change would be $100 change fee plus $25, for $125 total. Does that work for you?\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: Yeah, I guess that's not too bad. Alright, go ahead and switch me over to the 8:30 flight then. \\\\n\\\\nAgent: No problem, I've got you updated to the new flight. You'll see the changes reflected in your confirmation email. Is there anything else I can help with today?\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: No, I think that covers it.

I want to make a change to my reservation. \\\\n\\\\nAgent: No problem, I'd be happy to take a look at your reservation for you. What's the name the reservation is under?\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: It's under John Smith. The flight is from Chicago to Los Angeles, leaving next Tuesday. \\\\n\\\\nAgent: Okay, let me pull that up... *typing noises* Okay, I've got your reservation here Mr. Smith. What change did you need to make?\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: Well, something came up and I need to fly out a day earlier now. Is there any way I can change my flight to Monday instead of Tuesday?\\\\n\\\\nAgent: Let me check availability for Monday. *more typing* Hmm, it looks like that flight is pretty full on Monday. I'm only seeing availability in economy plus, would that work for you or were you looking to stay in the same cabin?\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: Ugh, yeah I was hoping for regular economy. What would an upgrade to economy plus cost me?\\\\n\\\\nAgent: Let me take a look... it looks like the difference in fare would be an additional $150 to upgrade to economy plus. Would you like me to go ahead and process that change for you? The good news is there would be no change fee since you're changing your plans more than a week before departure.\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: Hmm, $150 is a bit more than I was wanting to spend. Umm, is there any wiggle room on that price at all? Maybe you could waive the difference or give me a partial credit of some kind?\\\\n\\\\nAgent: I apologize, but I don't have much flexibility on the price difference, as economy plus is considered a premium cabin. However, let me check one other thing for you... *more typing* It looks like if I move you to the same flight on Tuesday, but in economy plus, I could potentially waive the difference in fare. That work for you? Then you'd still get the earlier departure you wanted.\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: You know, that could work. At least then I'd be getting something nicer for the same price as regular economy. Alright, go ahead and switch me over to that economy plus seat on Tuesday then. Thank you!\\\\n\\\\nAgent: No problem, I'm happy I could find a solution for you. Just one moment while I process this change...okay, all set! You're now booked in 6A for the Tuesday flight from Chicago to LA in economy plus. Your confirmation number is XXXXX. Please let me know if you need anything else.

Let me go ahead and get you booked on that Sunday flight and I'll also add a $150 flight voucher that you can use for future travel. Does that sound fair to make up for the missed meetings?\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: You know, I really appreciate you working with me on this Adam. $150 will definitely help with future trips.

What seemed to be the issue? \\\\n\\\\nCustomer: Well first of all, our flight was delayed by over 3 hours with no explanation. We missed our connecting flight and had to spend the night at the airport. Then when we finally took off, the food they served was disgusting. I mean it was barely edible. And to top it all off, the entertainment system on the back of my seat wasn't working so I couldn't even watch a movie to pass the time. This was the worst flight ever and I'm not happy. \\\\n\\\\nAgent: I understand your frustration sir. Airport delays are never fun, especially when you miss connections.

And the in-flight TV system, unfortunately those things sometimes malfunction. Can I offer you a refund or future travel credit as a gesture of goodwill?\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: A refund would be nice but honestly I just want to make sure this doesn't happen again next time I fly United. Your airline really needs to get it together. \\\\n\\\\nAgent: You're absolutely right, we need to improve. I'm going to file a detailed report about the problems you experienced to our operations and logistics teams. They can review what went wrong and hopefully implement changes to avoid similar issues in the future.

Can you go ahead and change my reservation?\\\\n\\\\nAgent: No problem, let me get that switched over for you now. *typing and clicking sounds* Okay, I've successfully changed your flight from the 2pm departure on Tuesday to the noon flight instead. You're all set with the new flight time. Will you need a confirmation email with the updated itinerary?\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: Yeah, an email would be great.

I'm calling because my flight from Chicago to LA was delayed by 4 hours and I missed my connection. I need to be rebooked on another flight today.\\\\n\\\\nAgent: I apologize for the long hold time, we've been experiencing higher than normal call volumes today. Let me pull up your reservation so I can take a look at rebooking you. May I have your confirmation number please?\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: Ugh it's X1234567. Just hurry up and get me on another flight, I have important meetings I need to make. \\\\n\\\\nAgent: Okay, give me just a moment... *typing noises* Alright, it looks like your flight from Chicago landed at 1:30pm but your connection to LA was at 12:45pm. Unfortunately all the flights from ORD to LAX are fully booked for the rest of the day. The next flight with availability isn't until tomorrow morning. I'm really sorry about this sir.\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: You've got to be kidding me! This is unacceptable, I need to be there today. Can't you bump someone off a flight or something? \\\\n\\\\nAgent: I understand your frustration sir, delayed flights are never ideal. Let me check a few things and see if there's anything I can do...*more typing* Unfortunately all the flights are completely full through our partners as well. I could potentially put you on standby for the 5pm flight but there's no guarantee you'd get a seat. I'm really sorry I don't have a better option for getting you there today. How does a nonstop flight tomorrow at 9am sound? I can have you upgraded to our United First class seats as a courtesy for the delay.\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: Upgraded to first class, big whoop. That doesn't get me to LA today like I need to. You guys lost me a whole day of work, do you have any idea how much money I'm losing because of this? \\\\n\\\\nAgent: You're right, an upgrade doesn't make up for missing an entire day of work. Let me check one more longshot option...sometimes we're able to find seats by bumping airline employees, if any happen to be flying standby today. Ah shoot, it looks like all flights are completely booked solid, even including employee seats. I really appreciate your patience sir, but unfortunately there just aren't any options to get you there today. The best I can do is get you out first thing tomorrow morning. I'm very sorry we couldn't get you rebooked today.\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: This is ridiculous. You guys are going to have to compensate me for this lost day of work. I expect a full refund of my ticket price and at least $500 for expenses. \\\\n\\\\nAgent: I can certainly understand your frustration, and I'd be upset too if I were in your position. Unfortunately our policy does not allow me to provide monetary compensation. The most I can offer is a full refund of your original ticket, as well as 15,000 bonus miles on your United account for the significant delay and missed connection. I hope this will provide some future travel flexibility to make up for today. Please let me know if you'd like me to process that refund and mileage credit for you.\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: You know what, forget it. Clearly United doesn't care about customers anymore. Thanks for absolutely nothing, you've been totally unhelpful. *slams phone down*\\\\n\\\\nAgent: Sir...sir are you still there?

This is ridiculous, I missed dinner plans and an important meeting because of your delay. \\\\n\\\\nAgent: I apologize for the significant delay to your flight, that is definitely frustrating to miss plans. May I have your confirmation number so I can take a look at what happened? *typing sounds* Okay, it looks like there was severe weather in Chicago last night that caused many flight cancellations and delays across the board. Did the gate agent offer you any information or compensation for the delay when you were at the airport?\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: Barely! They said the flight was delayed but that was it, no food vouchers or hotel, nothing. And now I've missed important things because of it. This is unacceptable service.\\\\n\\\\nAgent: You're right, a delay of that length deserves more information and compensation from the airline. Let me see what I can do for you. *more typing* For the inconvenience, I'm happy to offer you a $350 travel voucher that can be used for any future United flight. I'll also be refunding the full amount for your ticket last night. Does that help make up for the delay and your missed plans?\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: I guess it's something, but really this whole thing has left such a bad taste. Your delays are getting ridiculous, it seems like every time I fly with United there's some issue. You'd think with all the money people pay that you could get people where they need to go on time. \\\\n\\\\nAgent: You raise a fair point. Flight delays and cancellations are never acceptable and we need to do better. I can assure you that United is actively working to improve reliability. Why don't I also go ahead and give you free checked bags on your next 4 flights with us, as a small token of apology for the poor experience. I hope this helps make the situation right and maybe gives you a reason to give us another try. Is there anything else I can assist with today?\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: *sighs* I don't know, it just feels like too little too late at this point you know? But I guess the voucher and refund will have to do. It's just so frustrating, like why can't you all get it together. You lose customers this way. \\\\n\\\\nAgent: You're completely right, we don't want to lose loyal customers due to reliability issues. I'll be sure to note your feedback on this call in my report so United understands the level of frustration these delays cause. Thank you for taking the time to share your experience - it will truly help us to continue improving. Please feel free to reach back out if you have any other issues in the future. And I hope you have a better travel experience next time.\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: Yeah, we'll see I guess. Thanks for your help today at least. \\\\n\\\\nAgent: You're very welcome.

There is space available on that flight.\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: Ugh Friday doesn't really work either since I need to be there on Thursday for the meeting. Is there any way to get on an earlier flight even if I have to pay more? This meeting is really important for my job. \\\\n\\\\nAgent: I understand, missing important meetings is frustrating. *typing noises* Let me check a few other options. I'm not seeing any open seats we can switch you to for free given the restrictions on your fare. However, we do have some business class seats available on a flight tomorrow that I might be able to upgrade you to for an additional $500 fee. Would that be possible for you? It would get you there in time for your meeting.\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: *sighs* I really don't want to pay any more fees but it sounds like that may be my only option. As long as the $500 is cheaper than changing my flight plans otherwise, I guess I'll do it. Can you just go ahead and switch me to that business class seat for tomorrow?\\\\n\\\\nAgent: Absolutely, I'm happy I could find a solution to get you there on time.

The new arrival time in Tokyo is going to make me miss my connection to Osaka. I was hoping there was something you could do to help me out.\\\\n\\\\nAgent: I see, thanks for providing those details. Let me pull up your reservation and take a look. *typing sounds* Okay, it looks like your flight from Chicago to Tokyo is now scheduled to arrive at 11:15pm instead of the original 8:30pm time.

This delay is kinda throwing a wrench in my plans.\\\\n\\\\nAgent: I understand the frustration of a delay messing with your schedule. Let me check a few other possibilities here... *typing* It looks like I may be able to get you onto an earlier flight from Tokyo to Osaka, though you'd have a shorter layover. The connection would be very tight but if the flights are on time it should work. You'd arrive in Osaka only a few hours later than originally planned. Does that work for you or would you rather go with the direct flight and just push your travel plans back a day? \\\\n\\\\nCustomer: You know what, I think I'll risk the tight connection. As long as the flights aren't too much more money.

Let me check the fare for that itinerary... *more typing* Okay, good news - the price difference is minimal, only about $50 more than what you originally paid. I've gone ahead and booked you on those alternative flights now. You'll take United flight 1804 from Chicago to Tokyo, arriving at 9:15pm. Then United flight 1232 from Tokyo to Osaka, leaving at 3:15pm. Does this work alright for you?\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: Yeah that works, thanks so much for your help Sandra! I really appreciate you taking the time to find me a good option.\\\\n\\\\nAgent: You're very welcome, I'm glad I could help get your travel plans back on track.

The crew was working to fix a minor mechanical problem before departure to ensure passenger safety. As for running out of snacks, that's definitely not good service. We'll have to look into why they didn't properly stock the galley for a full flight. *coughs* What would you like me to do for you regarding this trip? \\\\n\\\\nCustomer: Well, I want some sort of compensation for putting up with all these issues. Your airline needs to do better. This is unacceptable customer service that I received. I've been a customer of United for years and this is how you treat me? I demand a refund or future travel credit.\\\\n\\\\nAgent: I understand your frustration, sir. Let me see what I can do for you here. *more typing* I'd be happy to provide you with a $150 travel voucher that's valid for your next flight with us within the next year.

What was the new return date you wanted?\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: I need to fly back on Saturday instead of the original Friday return. \\\\n\\\\nAgent: I'm afraid because that's within the 7 day period before departure, there would be a change fee of $150 to change the date.

Money is a bit tight right now. \\\\n\\\\nAgent: I understand, fees can definitely put a dent in your wallet. Let me check if there are any programs or promotions I can apply that may help waive the fee. *more typing sounds* Unfortunately nothing is coming up on your reservation that would qualify you for a waiver. I'm really sorry about that. Why did you need to change the return date if you don't mind me asking? Maybe there's an alternative option.\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: No worries, I appreciate you checking. The reason is actually kind of silly - my friend's wedding was moved to Saturday so I was hoping to stay an extra night. But it's not the end of the world if I can't, I'll just have to miss part of the wedding I guess. \\\\n\\\\nAgent: Hmm, missing your friend's wedding doesn't sound ideal. Let me take a look at some other options for you. How set are you on flying back out of LA? What if I could find you a flight into a different California airport on Saturday at a cheaper rate? That might save you enough to offset the change fee. \\\\n\\\\nCustomer: You know, as long as I'm back in time for the evening reception, I'm open to landing somewhere else. That could definitely work if it saves money overall.\\\\n\\\\nAgent: Okay, give me a few minutes to run some searches. *more typing and mouse clicking sounds* It looks like we have an available United flight landing in San Diego on Saturday around 1pm. I'm showing the fare is $150 less than your current return. If you book that instead and change your LA flight, it would only be a $50 difference which might be more doable than $150. What do you think?\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: Wow, you really came through for me Steve, that's perfect! Yes, let's go ahead and make that change. I really appreciate you taking the time to find an alternative like that. \\\\n\\\\nAgent: No problem at all, I'm glad we were able to work something out.

Let me take a look at your reservation. What are the original and new dates of travel? *typing sounds* Okay, it looks like your current ticket is non-refundable.

I know timing changes can be frustrating when things are tight. \\\\n\\\\nCustomer: Ugh yeah $50 is just more than I can swing right now honestly. This is so annoying, why do the prices have to change like that? Thanks for checking for me though Sam, I appreciate you taking the time. \\\\n\\\\nAgent: No problem, I understand the frustration. Let me see if there is anything else I can do to help. One moment please while I look over the options... *pause* You know, since this is a scheduling change on your part and not due to anything on our end, I'm going to waive that $50 change fee just this once. How does switching you to the 15th at no additional cost sound?\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: Really? That would be amazing, thank you so much! I really appreciate you working with me on this. Things have been pretty stressful lately with money and all. \\\\n\\\\nAgent: You're very welcome, I'm happy I could help get you rescheduled. Safe travels and I hope things start looking up for you soon. Remember that credit is valid for a year if you need to change the dates again. Thank you for flying with United.\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: Thanks so much Sam, you made this so much less of a headache for me. Have a good one!\\\\n\\\\nAgent: You too, take care!\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: Bye!\\\\n\\\\nAgent: Goodbye!\\\\n\\\\nHow's that?

I've been on hold for like 30 minutes. I need help with a flight I booked.\\\\n\\\\nAgent: I apologize for the long wait, we've been very busy. What seems to be the issue with your flight?\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: So I booked a flight from Chicago to LA next Tuesday but I need to change it. Like I know it's last minute but something came up and I can't make that flight anymore. \\\\n\\\\nAgent: I understand, last minute changes can be frustrating. Let me take a look at your reservation and see what options are available. May I have your confirmation number please?\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: Yeah, it's B345T69. *sighs loudly* I swear, every time I fly with you guys something goes wrong.\\\\n\\\\nAgent: Give me just a moment to pull that up...okay, I see your flight here. Unfortunately that flight for next Tuesday is fully booked so we won't be able to rebook you on the same route. Let me check some alternatives for you. *types rapidly on keyboard* It looks like we have seats available on a flight leaving Chicago at 3pm instead of the original 10am departure. Would that work for your schedule?\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: Ugh 3pm? That's so much later. Is there anything earlier? I was really hoping not to have to change the time too much.\\\\n\\\\nAgent: I understand the later time is less than ideal. Let me check a few other airlines as well to see if any have availability on similar departure times. *more keyboard typing* It doesn't look promising on our partner airlines either for same day changes. The 3pm flight is really the best option I'm seeing. I could also try to put you on a standby list for the original 10am flight in case any seats open up, but I can't guarantee you would get on that flight. \\\\n\\\\nCustomer: Man, this is annoying. I guess the 3pm flight will have to do then. Can you switch me over to that one? \\\\n\\\\nAgent: Of course, just one moment while I process the change for you. *keyboard typing for 30 seconds* Okay, I've got you all set on the 3pm departure next Tuesday. You may notice a small fare difference since it's a different flight, but I was able to waive the change fee for you given the last minute nature of this. Your new confirmation number is E456Z89. Please let me know if you need any other assistance!\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: Ugh fine, thanks I guess. This is so frustrating though, I wouldn't be in this mess if your first flight wasn't delayed last month. \\\\n\\\\nAgent: I'm sorry to hear you've been experiencing delays and issues. Delays are certainly frustrating as a passenger. I'll be sure to note your experience on this reservation so we can hopefully provide better service next time. Thank you for flying with us and I hope the 3pm flight works out better for your travel plans.

How may I help you today?\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: Hi, yeah I'm calling because I have a huge problem with my upcoming flight. Umm...let me check the flight number, it's flight 495 leaving tomorrow at 10am from Newark to LA. \\\\n\\\\nAgent: No problem, let me pull that flight up. What exactly seems to be the issue with the flight?\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: So the issue is, like last week my plans changed and I need to change the flight to leave on Friday instead of tomorrow. But when I try to do it online or on the app, it says the flight is non-refundable and non-changeable. And it's going to cost me like $500 more to change it which is ridiculous. \\\\n\\\\nAgent: I understand your frustration sir. Unfortunately many of our economy fares are non-refundable and have change fees if changed within 7 days of departure. Let me take a look at the availability and options for Friday. *typing noise* It looks like we do have seats available on flight 583 leaving Friday at 2pm. I can go ahead and process the change for you but you're correct, there would be a $450 change fee that would be due today. Does that work for your schedule?\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: Ugh $450 is still a lot. Isn't there anything you can do to waive that fee? Like I said my plans changed last minute for work otherwise I wouldn't need to change it. \\\\n\\\\nAgent: I apologize for the inconvenience sir. I understand last minute changes can be frustrating. Unfortunately with our non-refundable economy fares we have to charge a fee to cover our costs when people have to change their travel. Let me check really quickly to see if there's any exception I can apply for you given it's for work. *long pause as agent types* It doesn't look like I have any promotions I can apply today to waive the fee. However, if you book through our premium cabin with 24-hour cancellation, you wouldn't incur any change fees. It looks like we have availability in our Economy Plus seats which would be an additional $150 each way. You'd save the $450 change fee and get extra legroom. Would that be an option?\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: Ugh, $150 each way is also a lot more money. This is so annoying. I feel like you guys are just trying to squeeze every last cent out of people. Isn't there anything else you can do?\\\\n\\\\nAgent: I completely understand your frustration sir. Dealing with airline change fees is never ideal. Let me go ahead and put you on a brief hold while I check one more time with my supervisor to see if there's any exceptions that could be made. *hold music plays for 2 minutes* Thank you for your patience. I just spoke to my manager and unfortunately based on the fare rules there isn't anything more we can waive. I know it's not ideal, but if changing to the Economy Plus for $150 each way is still too high, your only other option would be to keep your original flight as planned tomorrow. Please let me know if you need any other assistance I can try to provide. I'm sorry I couldn't offer a better solution today.\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: You know what, fine I'll just grit my teeth and pay the $450 fee. Just go ahead and process the change to Friday please. \\\\n\\\\nAgent: Absolutely, let me go ahead and process that change for you now sir. It will take just a couple minutes to complete. As a courtesy, I'm happy to credit your account with 2 upgrade certificates that you can use within the next 12 months if any other issues come up. Thank you for your patience today and I hope you have a good rest of your day. Your new itinerary for Friday has been issued. Let me know if you need a copy of your confirmation sent over.\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: Okay thanks I appreciate that small gesture at least. Yeah can you just text me the new confirmation?

Let me see what options we have for getting you on another flight that day. One moment please...\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: Ugh this is just great. Of course this would happen right before an important business meeting. \\\\n\\\\nAgent: I apologize for the inconvenience, sir. It looks like we have one seat left on the 11:15am flight that day. Would moving your travel time back by a couple hours work for your schedule? \\\\n\\\\nCustomer: 11:15?! Are you kidding me, that's so late. That won't work at all for my meeting. Can't you just bump someone off the original flight?\\\\n\\\\nAgent: I understand the later flight doesn't work well for your plans. Unfortunately we aren't able to remove confirmed passengers from their booked flights for schedule changes. Let me check a few other flight options that day...*more typing* It looks like our 2pm flight and 4pm flight both have availability. I could update your reservation to one of those at no additional charge.\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: This is ridiculous. 2pm and 4pm? Might as well not even go at that point. I need to be there by noon for this meeting. Is there any way you can compensate me for this massive inconvenience? Maybe an upgrade on a future flight or some miles added to my account?\\\\n\\\\nAgent: You're right, sir, this has clearly caused you frustration and inconvenience. Let me go ahead and add 15,000 bonus miles to your frequent flyer account as a show of good faith. I'd also be happy to waive the change fee and get you booked on our earliest flight tomorrow instead if that works better for your schedule. How does that sound?\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: You know, tomorrow might actually be better since I can reschedule the meeting for then. Alright, go ahead and switch me to tomorrow then and I really appreciate the miles too. Thanks for your help, I feel a bit better about it now.\\\\n\\\\nAgent: You're very welcome, sir.

The whole experience was a nightmare from start to finish. \\\\n\\\\nAgent: I'm sorry to hear that. Can you tell me about your experience and I'll see what I can do to help?\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: Well first of all my flight from Chicago to Denver was delayed by over 3 hours! No explanation given at all. Then when I finally got on the plane it was so cramped I could barely move my legs. And then to top it all off I lost one of my bags during the layover in Denver. I need it located and delivered as soon as possible. This is unacceptable service. \\\\n\\\\nAgent: I understand your frustrations sir. A three hour delay with no communication is certainly not ideal. Let me pull up the records for your flight and see what caused the delay. *typing noises* It looks like there was severe weather in Chicago that day which caused multiple flight cancellations and delays across the board. I know that's not very helpful when you're stuck at the airport though. In regards to your lost bag, can you confirm the bag tag number so I can put a trace on it? We'll do everything we can to get it located and returned promptly.\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: The bag tag number is 45GR9876. And I don't care about the reason for the delay, three hours is ridiculous. You guys should have had a plan B to get people where they were going on time. \\\\n\\\\nAgent: You're right, a delay of that length is unacceptable. Umm, let me take a look and see what I can offer you as compensation. *more typing* According to our policies, for a delay of that duration you're entitled to a $600 voucher to be used for future United travel. I'm happy to credit that to your United MileagePlus account today. Does that help make up for some of the inconvenience?\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: I suppose $600 is better than nothing. But it still doesn't change the fact that your airline doesn't seem to have its act together. Who's to say this won't happen again next time I fly United? \\\\n\\\\nAgent: You raise a fair point. I can assure you that United is constantly working to improve operations and minimize delays, but bad weather will always be somewhat out of our control. Perhaps I could also credit your account with a future travel credit of $200 that you could use within the next year as an extra assurance. How does that sound? I really want to make this right and get you to feel comfortable flying with us again.\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: Alright, I guess that will have to do. Just please find my bag as soon as possible. \\\\n\\\\nAgent: You have my word we'll do everything we can to get that bag back to you promptly. Why don't you go ahead and give me your contact information so I can call you directly as soon as it's located? In the meantime, thank you for your patience and for bringing this issue to our attention. I hope the credits help smooth things over and I appreciate you giving United another chance.\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: Okay, my information is... *proceeds to give contact details* Just don't let me down on this bag. \\\\n\\\\nAgent: You have my assurance we won't let you down.

Is there any way I can change my ticket to a later date or maybe get a refund? \\\\n\\\\nAgent: I understand, travel plans do sometimes change unexpectedly. Let me check your ticket details and the refund/exchange policies. *more typing* It looks like your ticket is non-refundable since it was booked within 14 days of departure. However, we do allow one free change as long as you pay the difference in fare. What new dates were you thinking of traveling?\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: Hmm, that's what I was afraid of. *sighs* Okay, how about changing it to leave on June 1st instead? I know that's over two weeks later so there will definitely be a fare difference to pay.\\\\n\\\\nAgent: No problem, let me go ahead and process that date change for you. *typing and clicking sounds* Alright, it looks like the fare for that new June 1st flight is an additional $150. Does that work for you? I'll just need to collect that fare difference and then your ticket will be changed to the new date.\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: You know, $150 is a bit more than I was expecting to pay. Any chance you could waive any of those fees since I'm a really loyal United customer and have had elite status for years? It's really just bad timing that my plans fell through...\\\\n\\\\nAgent: I totally understand, unexpected changes are never convenient or cheap. Let me see if there's anything I can do for you as a valued frequent flyer. *typing* It looks like due to your high loyalty status, I can offer to reduce the change fee by $50. So the total to change your flight would be $100 instead of $150. Does that work a little better for your situation?\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: You know, I think $100 I can handle.

You'll receive a confirmation email with the updated flight details within the next 24 hours. Is there anything else I can help with today?\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: No, I think that covers it.

So the same flight but next Thursday instead of tomorrow?\\\\n\\\\nAgent: Let me check on that date for you. *more typing* It looks like that date is available, but unfortunately there would be a change fee of $200 plus any difference in fare since you purchased a non-refundable ticket. Does that work for you?\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: Are you kidding me? $200 just to change the date? That's ridiculous! *sighs heavily* I guess I don't really have a choice, do I? Fine, go ahead and change it. But I'm not happy about this fee. Your change policies are way too strict. \\\\n\\\\nAgent: I understand your frustration sir, unfortunately those are the rules with the type of ticket you purchased. We do have more flexible options for a small price difference upfront. Just give me a moment to process the change for you. *typing, a few clicks* Okay, all set! Your new flight is confirmed for one week from tomorrow. The fee and any additional fare has been charged to the credit card on file.

I see there is a change fee but hopefully it's not too much more. Money is a bit tight at the moment. \\\\n\\\\nAgent: Let me take a look... *more typing* It looks like the change fee for domestic flights is usually $200 per ticket.

What's the flight number?\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: It's flight 1981, departing at 10am. \\\\n\\\\nAgent: *typing sounds* Okay, I've got the flight up. The forecast does look a bit stormy for Monday unfortunately. Let me see what our options are for you just in case it gets cancelled or delayed. *pause as typing continues* It looks like we have seats available on flights both before and after yours. We could move you to an 8am departure or a 1pm, both should get you into LA about the same time. \\\\n\\\\nCustomer: Hmm those times aren't ideal since I have meetings scheduled. Any chance the Monday flight will still happen on time?\\\\n\\\\nAgent: It's hard to say for certain with weather, but based on the current forecast I'd say there is a possibility of delays. The storm isn't expected to move through until later that afternoon so there is a chance your flight could get out on time or with only a short delay. If the flight does get cancelled though, would you like me to go ahead and switch you to one of those other times I mentioned? That way you'd have a confirmed seat either way?\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: Ah yeah let's do that, umm switch me to the 1pm flight just to be safe. Don't wanna risk missing my meetings if the morning one gets delayed too long.\\\\n\\\\nAgent: No problem, I completely understand. Let me go ahead and process that change for you now to the 1pm flight. *typing noises* Okay, you're all set on the later flight. The good news is it's nonstop so you shouldn't have any connections to worry about getting delayed. And just in case the weather does clear up, feel free to check back in with us over the weekend - we may be able to switch you back to the original time if those flights are still on schedule.

Unfortunately that flight for next Friday is fully booked so changing the dates won't be possible without paying a change fee. Let me check availability for the following week though... *more typing* It looks like we have seats available on the same flight but departing the following Friday. I can swap your dates over to then at the cost of a $150 change fee per ticket since it's within 7 days of departure. How does that work for you?\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: Ugh, $150 is pretty steep. Is there any way you could waive the fee since I'm just changing the dates and not cancelling? It's really not my fault the plans changed. \\\\n\\\\nAgent: I understand the fee is significant. Unfortunately with bookings this close to travel, our policies don't allow me to waive change fees. I could take a look at options with later departure times on your new travel dates that may be cheaper though. Let me see what else is available that week... *more typing noises* It looks like there is space on the red-eye flight departing at midnight on your new travel Friday. That one would only be a $50 change fee per ticket since it's an alternative flight time. Would you like me to switch your reservation over to that midnight departure?\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: Hmm, a midnight flight isn't great but $50 is better than $150. Alright, let's go ahead and change it to that late flight. Will the rest of the itinerary stay the same with the same return date?\\\\n\\\\nAgent: Yes, switching just the outbound flight will keep your current return flight and itinerary intact.

I could switch your flight to that one at no extra cost. However, I know that's still later than you wanted.

I really need to be in LA by 10pm for this meeting, it's a big client. *sighs loudly* Is there any chance of getting on an earlier flight or getting reimbursed somehow for having to reschedule my meeting? \\\\n\\\\nAgent: I apologize for the inconvenience. Let me pull up our compensation policies...so since this delay was due to weather which is outside of our control, we unfortunately would not offer any compensation in that case. However, I'm looking at options now for getting you there earlier. It looks like I may be able to upgrade you to our first class cabin on a flight leaving at 4pm which would get you into LA by 7:15pm. I'd need to charge you the difference in fare but that would be the quickest option to get you there on time. Does that work for you?\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: Hmm that's better I guess. How much more is the fare difference going to be for first class? This is really putting me out so I don't want to pay some ridiculous amount. \\\\n\\\\nAgent: Let me check the exact price difference...okay, upgrading you to first class would be an additional $250 on top of what you've already paid. I know that's not ideal but hopefully it allows you to make your important meeting. And as an apology for the delay, I can also offer you a $100 credit to use on a future United flight. Does that work for you?\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: *long pause* alright, fine - go ahead and switch me to that first class flight. And I better get my $100 credit! Thanks for your help John, I appreciate you getting me on that earlier flight.\\\\n\\\\nAgent: You're very welcome, sir.

I was hoping to avoid that fee since it was kind of your airline's fault my plans changed. \\\\n\\\\nAgent: I'm sorry to hear your plans changed, but may I ask what caused the change that was related to United? Sometimes there are exceptions we can look at if there was a delay or cancellation on our end.\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: Well it's not directly United's fault, but the conference I was going to got postponed because of a snowstorm in Seattle last week. Since the weather caused the change and now my trip is pointless, I thought maybe you'd work with me on the fee.\\\\n\\\\nAgent: Ah I see, that is unfortunate timing. Unfortunately since the snowstorm itself did not directly impact your original flight, we wouldn't be able to waive the change fee in this situation. I know that's not the answer you were hoping for.

What flight were you originally supposed to take? *types for a few seconds* Okay, I see here your flight from Chicago to Denver was delayed over 2 hours due to maintenance issues. Let me take a look at getting you rebooked on another flight to make your connection. *more typing* Unfortunately the next direct flight to Houston is also delayed, but I do have an option to reroute you through Dallas that will still get you there on time. It's about an hour layover in Dallas but it should work. I'll go ahead and process the rebooking for you.\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: An hour layover doesn't give me much time, is there anything with a little more of a buffer? I really don't want to risk missing this connection too.\\\\n\\\\nAgent: You're right, with delays happening an hour isn't much of a cushion. Let me see if I can find another option for you. *typing* The only other possibility I'm seeing is changing your originating flight from Chicago to an earlier one that will allow for a 3 hour layover in Dallas. You'd have to get to O'Hare airport a couple hours earlier than originally planned though. Would that work better for you or would you rather stick with the hour connection?\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: Umm, that earlier flight sounds better honestly. I'd rather have the longer layover just to be safe since this trip has been such a mess so far. How much earlier would I need to be at O'Hare? \\\\n\\\\nAgent: According to the schedule, the earlier flight would depart Chicago at 10:15am instead of the original 1:30pm flight. So you'd need to be at the airport by 8:30am to account for any potential delays and go through security. Does that timing work for your travel plans today? I know it'll mean leaving pretty early but it should get you to Houston more comfortably with that 3 hour cushion in Dallas.\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: Ah man, 8:30 is really pushing it since I had to take a morning flight out of Milwaukee already. But I guess it's better than potentially missing my connection. Alright, let's go ahead and switch me over to that 10:15 flight then. I appreciate you finding me a better option.\\\\n\\\\nAgent: No problem, I'm happy I could find a solution that works a little better for your schedule even if it means an earlier departure. Just want to make sure you can get where you need to go as smoothly as possible. Let me process that rebooking for you now. Okay, you're all set on the 10:15am flight from Chicago to Dallas with a 3 hour layover before continuing on to Houston. The confirmation number for the new itinerary is H3Y5R9. Please let me know if you have any other questions!\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: Great, thank you so much Maria. I really appreciate you taking the time to help me out - it will definitely make this trip less stressful. Have a good rest of your day!\\\\n\\\\nAgent: You're very welcome, I'm glad I could help.

Your flight into LAX from Chicago was delayed due to weather and will now arrive at 1:30pm instead of 8:30am. Unfortunately that does mean you'll miss your connection to San Francisco. Let me take a look at our other flight options to get you there. *longer pause as agent searches flights* \\\\n\\\\nCustomer: Agh I have an important meeting in SF tomorrow that I really can't miss. This is so frustrating, why did the flight have to be delayed. \\\\n\\\\nAgent: I understand your frustration, delays are never ideal. Unfortunately with the winter weather we've been having, these things are sometimes out of our control. Let me see, the next nonstop to SFO departs LAX at 4:15pm and would get you into SFO at 5:45pm. How does that look? I can get you booked on that flight.\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: Umm that might work actually as long as I can make my meeting. It's at 7pm, do you think I'll have enough time if I land at 5:45? \\\\n\\\\nAgent: With normal traffic, I'd say that's cutting it close but should be doable. We can also see about upgrading you to a higher class of service if available, which may give you better seating and quicker deplaning. Let me check on upgrade availability and pricing for you. *more typing* It looks like we have some extra legroom seats available for an additional $150. Would you like me to book you in that seat? It should help ensure you make your meeting on time.\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: You know what, yeah go ahead and book me the upgrade, $150 is worth it to not miss this meeting.

Let me take a look at the current forecast for next Tuesday...*typing sounds* From what I'm seeing, it looks like the storm system may start moving through Chicago in the late afternoon, so it shouldn't impact your morning departure time. Of course, things can always change with weather. Is there a particular reason this flight is important to take on Tuesday?

Would that work or would you rather go with the hotel and morning flight option?\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: Umm, I don't know... that other airport is pretty far from where I need to go.

Please allow 7-10 business days for that to process. In addition, we'll be sending you a $100 flight credit as an additional apology. Thank you for your time today and for being a loyal customer in the past - I hope this makes up for the troubles to some extent.\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: Fine, I guess that will have to do.

This is unacceptable, I need to figure out how you're going to compensate me for this. \\\\n\\\\nAgent: Let me take a look here...okay I see your flight from Chicago to New York was delayed due to maintenance issues. The flight is now scheduled to depart at 11:15. I completely understand your frustration with missing your meeting. Let me see what options I can provide to help make this right. *pause as agent reviews policies and options* It looks like because this was due to a mechanical issue and not weather, I can offer you a $400 flight credit since the delay was over 2 hours. I'll also make sure you get put on our fastest connection to New York today. How does that sound?\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: A $400 flight credit? Are you kidding me? That does nothing for the fact that I missed an important client meeting today. I need to be reimbursed for that. This delay is costing me business. \\\\n\\\\nAgent: You're right, I apologize the flight credit doesn't address the impact to your meeting. Let me see if there's anything else I can do. One moment please...okay, in addition to the $400 flight credit I'm also going to refund the full fare of your ticket since this was such a significant delay over 2 hours. I'll make sure that processes within the next 24 hours. On top of that, I'm adding a $500 customer service voucher that can be used for any future United travel-related costs like baggage fees or upgrades. Please let me know if this resolves your issue or if there's anything else I can assist with today?\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: I guess that will have to do. This better not happen again next time I fly United. You guys really need to get your act together with these delays. \\\\n\\\\nAgent: I understand your frustration and really appreciate your patience today. I can assure you we don't take these kinds of delays lightly and our maintenance teams are working hard to fix the issue. Please accept my apologies again.

How may I help you today?\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: Hi Jeff, yeah I'm calling about a flight I have booked from Chicago to San Francisco next Tuesday. I just wanted to double check a few things about the booking.\\\\n\\\\nAgent: No problem, I'd be happy to take a look at your booking details for you. What's the last name the reservation is under?\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: It's under Johnson. Flight number is UA1245 leaving Chicago O'Hare at 10am.\\\\n\\\\nAgent: Okay, let me pull that up... *typing noises* Yep, I've got the booking here for Jason Johnson on flight UA1245 leaving Chicago at 10am and arriving in San Francisco at 12:30pm. What specifically did you need to check on the reservation?\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: Well, umm... *pause* ahh I was hoping to change the flight to an earlier departure if possible. My meeting out there got moved up a couple hours and the 10am flight won't work for me anymore. Do you have anything leaving around 8am?\\\\n\\\\nAgent: Let me take a look at our flight options for that day... *more typing* It looks like the only other non-stop flight we have leaving Chicago for San Francisco that day departs at 7:45am. We would just need to process a change fee since you're altering the booking within the refundable period. The fee is $150 plus any difference in fare. The good news is the fare for that earlier flight is actually $25 less than what you already paid. So after the change fee it should only be a $125 total upgrade cost. Does that 7:45am flight work better for your schedule?\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: Ah yeah, that 7:45 flight will work much better. Okay, go ahead and switch me over to that one then. I can give you my credit card info for the change fee now. \\\\n\\\\nAgent: Great, I'm happy we could accommodate the earlier departure for you. If you want to provide me with your credit card number, I'll go ahead and process that change. Oh, and just so you know, since that flight is leaving earlier in the day, make sure to check in online at least 24 hours before departure to select your seat assignment. Go ahead and read me the credit card number when you're ready.\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: Okay, the number is 5522-1223-3444-5556. Expiration is 03/25.\\\\n\\\\nAgent: Thank you, I've successfully processed the change fee on that card. You'll receive an email confirmation within the next 24 hours reflecting the updated flight details. Please let me know if you have any other questions!\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: Sounds good, thanks so much for your help Jeff! I really appreciate you getting me switched over to that earlier flight.\\\\n\\\\nAgent: You're very welcome, I'm glad I could assist. Enjoy your trip to San Francisco!

I just saw they issued a winter storm warning for the northeast tomorrow starting early in the morning and I'm supposed to be on an important business meeting in LA. \\\\n\\\\nAgent: *typing sounds* Okay, let me pull up the details on flight 1982. *pause* Based on the current forecast, it does look like some light snow is expected in New York tomorrow morning however our weather team is monitoring it closely. At this time the flight is still scheduled as planned. Of course that could change if the storm ends up being worse than expected. What would you like me to do in case of a cancellation?\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: Ugh I really don't want to have to reschedule my whole trip. Is there any way I can get on an earlier flight just to be safe? I'd pay more, I just really need to make this meeting.\\\\n\\\\nAgent: I understand your concern about making the meeting. Let me check if there are any seats available on earlier flights... *typing noises* Unfortunately the next flight to LA leaves at 5am and it's completely booked. I'm sorry about that. If your 8am flight does get canceled, I can get you booked on our first available alternate flight. In the meantime, I'd suggest signing up for flight alerts on our app or checking the status online closer to your departure time. We'll also call or email if there are any changes. Does that work for you or is there anything else I can help with?\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: I don't know, this is so frustrating. Why can't you guys ever get me there on time? My flight was delayed last month too. Seems like you all can't get it together. \\\\n\\\\nAgent: I understand your frustration sir, flight delays and cancellations are never ideal. Unfortunately Mother Nature sometimes has other plans. Please know that we will do everything we can to get you to your destination as scheduled or as quickly as possible if there are any issues out of our control. Hopefully the forecast changes and your flight operates without any problems. If you do end up delayed or cancelled, be assured I'll have you booked on the next available flight.

Oh, one more thing, what's the policy if the flight gets delayed or canceled? \\\\n\\\\nAgent: No problem, it's always good to double check before traveling. If your flight is delayed, we'll provide snack vouchers and help rebook you on the next available flight to your destination. Delays over 3 hours are considered a significant schedule change and you'd be eligible for a refund if you no longer want to travel. If the flight is unfortunately canceled, we'll rebook you on the next United flight with available seats at no additional cost. You'd also qualify for a full refund if you don't want to fly out at a later time. Does this help explain our cancellation and delay policies?\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: Yeah, that helps clarify things.

Just one other thing, I wanted to double check how I check-in online versus at the airport. It's been a while since I've flown with you guys.\\\\n\\\\nAgent: No problem, it's always good to be thorough with travel details. For online check-in, you can do that starting 24 hours before your domestic flight or 30 days before an international flight. Just go to united.com and login with your booking reference and last name. You'll be able to receive your boarding passes electronically. If you check in at the airport, make sure to arrive at least an hour before a domestic flight or two hours for international. Just head to one of the check-in kiosks or counters with your ID. Does this help explain the options? Let me know if any other questions come up!\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: Yeah that helps, thanks. I think I'll do the online check-in this time to make things easier.

Can you tell me about your experience on the flight?\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: The flight was a nightmare. First, our departure was delayed by over an hour with no explanation.

As for the WiFi, it appears the satellite connection was down during your flight. That's definitely frustrating when you pay extra for the service.\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: That's unacceptable. I had important work to do and couldn't access any of my files because the WiFi wasn't working. Now I'm behind schedule. You need to give me a refund or something as compensation. \\\\n\\\\nAgent: You're right, sir, the service issues were unacceptable. Let me see what I can offer you as compensation. *more typing* Unfortunately I'm unable to provide a full refund for the WiFi since you did fly on the flight. However, I'd be happy to offer you a $100 travel voucher for your next United flight as an apology for the delay and technical problems. Will that work for you?\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: A $100 voucher? That barely covers the WiFi fees! I want half of my entire round trip ticket price back. This flight ruined my day.\\\\n\\\\nAgent: I understand your frustration, sir, but unfortunately providing half of the round trip fare back would be against company policy. The $100 voucher is the highest level of compensation I'm able to offer based on the circumstances. However, let me check one moment if my supervisor can offer anything additional. Please hold. *puts customer on hold for 30 seconds* \\\\n\\\\nAgent: Thank you for your patience. I've discussed this with my supervisor and we'd like to offer you a $200 travel voucher as well as 500 airline miles as a goodwill gesture.

Will that updated compensation package be more acceptable?\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: *long sigh* I suppose $200 is better than nothing. Fine, I'll accept that. But you better believe I won't be flying United anytime soon after this mess of a flight. \\\\n\\\\nAgent: I understand your frustration and don't blame you at all. Please know that we are sincerely sorry for all the problems. I hope the compensation at least helps make up for it a little. Thank you for bringing this to our attention - it will help us improve.

Does that work for you?\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: Hmm, $150 does seem like a lot to change the time. Any chance you could maybe waive the fee since it's a schedule change on my end? It's really only a couple hours difference.\\\\n\\\\nAgent: I understand your concern about the fee. Unfortunately our change policies are in place to help ensure availability on flights. Let me take a look here...I don't see any notes on your reservation about waiving change fees. However, as a one-time courtesy I can offer to reduce the fee to $75 since your request is a smaller schedule change within the same day. Does that work a little better for you?\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: You know, $75 is still a lot but I really need to change this flight. Alright, go ahead and switch me over to the 12:15 flight and I'll pay the $75 fee. Thanks for your help Sam.\\\\n\\\\nAgent: You're very welcome, I'm glad we were able to work something out.

The following day doesn't work for me either though, I really need to land in LA on that Wednesday. Is there any sort of compensation you can offer since I now have to reschedule some things because of the delay?\\\\n\\\\nAgent: I understand the delay is very inconvenient. Let me check what I can offer...*more typing* It looks like I can offer you a $150 flight credit that is valid for one year, which could help offset the cost if you need to reschedule other travel plans. I'm afraid that's the best I can do in this situation since all flights that day are sold out. Does that credit help at all or is there anything else I can explore to assist you?\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: *long sigh* Yeah I guess the credit will have to do. This is really frustrating though, you guys changed the schedule without any warning. Is there a way to get notified of changes like this in the future?\\\\n\\\\nAgent: You're right to be frustrated, we definitely could have communicated the schedule change better. To help prevent this from happening again, I'm going to add you to our schedule change notification list for all future flights you book directly with us. That way if any flights you're booked on end up getting delayed or rescheduled, you'll receive an email right away. I'll also make a note on your reservation that you requested this. Does that help provide some reassurance going forward?\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: Yeah, that notification thing is a good idea. Alright, well I guess I'll just have to deal with this delay then.

Let me see what options we have for changing that date... *typing noises* Hmm it looks like the flights are pretty full for the dates you're looking to travel. Would a few days later work instead of earlier?\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: Ugh no, it really has to be earlier. Like this Monday would be ideal, May 9th. Is there any chance there's seats available then? \\\\n\\\\nAgent: Just one second, let me check Monday for you... *more typing* Shoot, I'm not seeing any seats left on flights that day. The flights are booked solid since it's closer to the date. Let me check a couple other days... How does Tuesday look? There might be something on Tuesday the 10th.\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: Ah man, Tuesday won't work either. I was really hoping to change it to Monday. Is there any way to get on that flight? I'm really in a bind here. \\\\n\\\\nAgent: I apologize for the inconvenience. Let me take a closer look here... *typing progressively gets louder as if hitting keys more aggressively* Ugh, I'm really not seeing any options for Monday. The flight is completely full. Due to how close it is to the travel date, a lot of the seats are unable to be changed. Unfortunately there's not much I can do in this situation. Would you like me to try reaching out to the reservations team on your behalf to see if maybe they have any suggestions? It's a long shot but it can't hurt.\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: *signs heavily* Yeah I guess it couldn't hurt to try. This is so frustrating. I really need to be in LA by Tuesday. Alright, please check with the reservations team and see if they have any ideas. I'd really appreciate anything they could do.\\\\n\\\\nAgent: No problem, I completely understand the frustration. Let me give them a call now and I'll call you back as soon as I hear from them. It may take a little while so please hang tight. What number can I reach you back at?\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: Okay, thanks so much. You can call me back at 555-5234. I really appreciate you trying to help with this.\\\\n\\\\nAgent: You're very welcome, I'll do my best to try and get you rescheduled. Sit tight and expect my call back shortly. Thank you for your patience. *call ends*\\\\n\\\\nAgent: *calling customer back* Hi Bob, this is John from United calling you back. So I just got off the phone with reservations and unfortunately they weren't able to find any seats available for you on that Monday flight. However, they did mention that there is a chance of openings if people end up canceling their reservations last minute. So they're going to put an alert on that flight for me and give me a call first thing Monday morning if anything frees up. Would you like me to try and book you at that point if I do hear of a cancellation?\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: Ugh, that's disappointing but I appreciate you both checking. Yeah, please go ahead and try to book me if something opens up on Monday. This really sucks but I guess that's the best option at this point. Thanks again for all your help, I know you did what you could.\\\\n\\\\nAgent: You're very welcome, I'm sorry I couldn't do more to get you rescheduled. Fingers crossed that we get a last minute cancellation. I'll be sure to call you first thing Monday morning if that happens. Thanks so much for flying with us and have a good rest of your day!\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: You too, thanks John.\\\\n\\\\nAgent: You're very welcome, have a good one! *call ends*\", 780.0, 300.0, 187770, \"neutral\", \"frustrated\", -0.06, 0.21, \"IRROPS\", \"Kim Casey\", 2.0], [9001002107, 3989657339, 479414, \"2024-08-31 22:40:00\", \"2024-08-31 22:43:00\", \"2024-08-31 22:44:00\", \"\\\\n\\\\nAgent: Thank you for calling United Airlines, this is John speaking.

What would you like to know about that flight?\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: Ahh well, I was hoping to change the date of the flight. Is there any way I can move it to next Wednesday instead? Work stuff has come up and I need to be in LA a few days later.\\\\n\\\\nAgent: I understand, schedules can change unexpectedly. Let me take a look at flights for next Wednesday. *typing sounds* Okay, it looks like we do have seats available on a flight leaving Chicago at 11am and arriving in LA at 1pm. I'll just need to double check if there will be any change fees since you're wanting to change the date...*more typing* According to the terms of your ticket, you can change the date with no fees as long as you do so at least a week before the original travel date. Does that work for you?\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: Yeah, that flight works great actually. I'll go ahead and change it to that one. *sigh of relief* Thanks so much for checking that for me, I really appreciate the flexibility.\\\\n\\\\nAgent: You're very welcome, I'm glad I could help get you rescheduled.

How may I help you today?\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: Hi Adam, thanks for taking my call. I'm calling about a flight I have booked from Chicago to London next week. \\\\n\\\\nAgent: No problem, what would you like to know about your flight?\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: Umm, I'm a little concerned about the weather forecast. I saw there's a chance of storms in Chicago during my departure time. Will the flight still go ahead as scheduled?\\\\n\\\\nAgent: Let me pull up the details of your reservation and take a look at the forecast. What's the date and flight number? *typing noises* Okay, I've got it here. According to the latest forecast from the National Weather Service, there is a 40% chance of thunderstorms in the Chicago area next Thursday afternoon when your flight to London is scheduled to depart. The storms aren't expected to be severe, but it is a possibility they could cause some delays. As long as the weather clears up within an hour or two, the flight should still go ahead. But I'll put a weather waiver on your reservation just in case it gets cancelled or delayed due to the storms. That way we can rebook you without any change fees.\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: Okay, that makes me feel a bit better. So what options would I have if it did get cancelled? Would I be able to fly out the next day instead?\\\\n\\\\nAgent: Let me check availability for flights the following day... *more typing* It looks like if your flight on Thursday is cancelled, we'd have a few options to rebook you on. There's a direct flight leaving Chicago around the same time on Friday that would get you into London in the evening. Or there's an earlier flight with a connection in New York that would have you arriving in London in the late afternoon. Both of those flights have seats available. We'd get you booked on the earliest possible option. And of course, any difference in fare would be waived with the weather waiver. Does flying on Friday work with your schedule if Thursday doesn't work out?\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: Friday would work yeah, that would give me a bit of a buffer with my meetings in London. Just wanted to check all the options. Thanks for looking into that for me, Adam. I feel better having a backup plan. \\\\n\\\\nAgent: You're very welcome, I'm glad I could help put your mind at ease. Flying can always be a bit stressful, especially with things like the weather that are out of our control. But that's why we're here, to help make the process as smooth as possible. Is there anything else I can assist with today regarding your reservation?\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: No, I think you've covered everything. I really appreciate you taking the time to go through all the details with me. It's nice to get reassurance from the airline directly.\\\\n\\\\nAgent: You're most welcome. Thank you for flying with United, I hope you have a fantastic trip to London. And please don't hesitate to call back if any other questions come up before your travels. Safe travels!\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: Thank you so much, have a good rest of your day!\\\\n\\\\nAgent: You too, take care!\\\\n\\\\n*fake phone hanging up sounds*\\\\n\\\\nI tried to craft a natural-sounding dialogue between the agent and customer to address the customer's concern about potential weather delays within the given call duration.

I was hoping there was something you could do to change my flight.\\\\n\\\\nAgent: Sorry to hear you're not feeling well. Let me take a look at your booking details. What's the name the reservation is under?\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: It's under James Smith.\\\\n\\\\nAgent: Okay, let me pull that up...*typing noises*...alright I've got your reservation here James. Since your flight is within the next 7 days we're only able to offer you a credit for future travel rather than a refund. Would you like me to go ahead and cancel this booking and provide you with a credit to rebook for a later date once you're feeling better?\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: Umm yeah that would be great. How long is the credit valid for?\\\\n\\\\nAgent: Credit certificates from flight cancellations are valid for one year from the date of issue. So in your case the credit would be good for travel through next January. Do you have a idea of when you might want to rebook your flight for? I can take a quick look and see what options are available.\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: *coughs* Sorry, ugh this cold is really kicking my butt. Hmm is there anything end of February or early March you see available? I'd like to go out for a long weekend if possible. \\\\n\\\\nAgent: No problem, take your time. *typing noises* Let's see, for travel from Chicago to Seattle the last weekend of February I'm seeing flights on Thursday the 23rd and returning Monday the 27th that would work. Does that work with your schedule?\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: Yeah those dates look great! Can you go ahead and cancel my original flight and book me on those new dates instead please?\\\\n\\\\nAgent: Absolutely, just one moment while I process the cancellation and rebooking for you...*more typing*...okay all set! Your original flight has been cancelled without penalty and you're now booked to fly out on February 23rd and return on the 27th.

It's now scheduled to depart at 11:15am instead of the original 9:30am time. \\\\n\\\\nCustomer: Oh wow, that's a significant delay. Do you know what the cause is?\\\\n\\\\nAgent: Umm, let me check the notes here...it looks like there was some maintenance issues they needed to take care of on the aircraft. They're still working to get it resolved but wanted to give passengers a heads up of the new scheduled departure time. I apologize for any inconvenience the delay may cause.\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: No problem, thanks for letting me know. At least I have a bit more time to get to the airport now. Do you think there's a chance it could get delayed even further? Just want to know if I should give myself extra time to get there just in case.\\\\n\\\\nAgent: Ahh yeah, it's always a good idea to plan for potential further delays just in case. Let me take a look at the aircraft and make sure there aren't any other issues noted... *more typing* It doesn't look like there are any other known issues right now. As long as the maintenance work goes smoothly I wouldn't expect a further delay.

What seems to be the issue with your flight? Let me see what I can do to help resolve it.\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: So I booked a flight from New York to LA for next Thursday but now I can't make that flight. I've been trying for days to change it but your automated system just keeps giving me errors. Every time I call, I'm on hold for hours too. It's ridiculous!

I'm so frustrated, this is unacceptable customer service. \\\\n\\\\nAgent: I understand your frustration sir. Let me see what I can do for you. *more typing* Unfortunately that route is fully booked on Monday. The next available flight I see is on Wednesday. I can swap you over to that flight at no additional cost since this is a change on our end. Will Wednesday work for your travel plans?\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: Ugh, Wednesday? That's not really going to work either. I need to be back in LA by Tuesday for a big meeting. This is ridiculous. Why can't you guys ever get anything right? Now I'm going to miss my meeting and it's all your fault. \\\\n\\\\nAgent: I apologize for the inconvenience, sir. Transfers can be challenging to accommodate depending on availability. Let me see if there are any other options...*typing for a while with mouse clicking noises* It looks like I may be able to get you on a redeye flight on Sunday night instead that will get you into LA early on Monday morning. I'd have to book you on our partner airline but it would avoid changing the dates too much. How does that sound?\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: Sunday night? Umm, I guess that could work as long as I definitely get there on Monday. But it better not cost me any extra money on top of what I already paid for the original flight. \\\\n\\\\nAgent: I understand your concern. Let me go ahead and process the change to the Sunday night redeye on our partner airline. The good news is, as a one-time exception, we'll waive the change fee since this was an itinerary change on our end. You'll still pay the same fare as your original ticket. I'm just going to need to verify your payment information to transfer you over. Go ahead and read it back to me when you're ready.\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: Okay, you know what, that Sunday flight actually sounds like it'll work. I really appreciate you taking the time to help me out - it seems like no one else at your airline wants to. At least I'll get to my meeting now.

Um, one other question...if I change it to Friday, will I get the same seat assignment that I currently have?\\\\n\\\\nAgent: Let me check your seat assignment.

Is there anything similar timing on Sunday?\\\\n\\\\nAgent: Checking Sunday now... *typing* Unfortunately the Sunday flights are showing up as more full.

Is there any way to waive the change fee since my plans changed last minute?\\\\n\\\\nAgent: I understand the timing doesn't work well for you. Unfortunately with it being so close to your travel date, our change fees are non-waivable. However, let me take a quick look at our business class inventory - sometimes we have last minute upgrades available there that could give you a better flight time. *more typing and clicking* It looks like we do have space available in business class on Sunday, leaving at 11am and getting into New York at 1pm. The difference in fare would be $200 but there would be no change fee since it's an upgrade.

Can you help me with that?\\\\n\\\\nAgent: Absolutely, I'm happy we could find an option that will work better for your schedule.

Does that all look correct to you?\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: Yes, that all sounds right. How can I pay the upgrade fee? \\\\n\\\\nAgent: Great, thank you for confirming. I'll go ahead and process the upgrade on my end. To pay the $200 upgrade fee, I'll need the credit card number associated with the reservation. Once I have that, I can complete the transaction and send you an email receipt confirming the flight change.

What seems to be the issue with your flight? Let me see if I can help resolve things.\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: So I had a flight from Chicago to Seattle last Thursday but it got delayed by over 3 hours. Then when I finally got on the plane, we sat on the tarmac for another hour before taking off. I missed an important meeting because of it and my boss is not happy. \\\\n\\\\nAgent: Oh wow, that is really frustrating. *types into computer* Let me take a look at your flight details and see what happened. *noise in background, seems to be other calls coming in* Umm, it looks like there was severe weather in Chicago that caused many departure delays that day. Unfortunately there wasn't much we could do but wait it out. I completely understand why you'd be upset about missing your meeting.\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: Yeah, the weather wasn't great but three hours just seems excessive. And then another hour on the plane! It's ridiculous. Is there any sort of compensation you can offer for the delay and hassle? I spent a lot of money on this flight.\\\\n\\\\nAgent: You're right, that is a very long delay. Let me see what I can do for you. *types some more* I'm able to offer you a $500 travel voucher for your next United flight since this one caused you to miss important plans. Will that help make up for some of the trouble? I know it doesn't make up for the meeting but hopefully it shows we want to take care of our loyal customers.\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: Hmm, that does help a little I guess. I really appreciate you taking the time to look into this for me. It was just so stressful, you know? I'll never fly with United again if this is how it's going to be.\\\\n\\\\nAgent: I completely understand your frustration, believe me we never want our customers to have experiences like this. Flying these days is stressful enough. Thank you for bringing this to my attention\\u2014I'll make sure to note your record that you had issues on this flight so we can try to provide better service if you do end up flying with us again. And please know that severe delays like what happened aren't the norm. I hope the voucher helps make the situation a little less irritating.\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: Alright, thanks Steve I appreciate you looking into it. Sorry I was kind of grumpy, it's been a day. At least the voucher will come in handy. Thanks for your help!\\\\n\\\\nAgent: No problem at all, you had every right to be frustrated. I hope the rest of your day improves.

The fare difference between the flights is only $25 so that will be the additional amount due to switch to the 3pm flight.\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: Oh okay, yeah $25 is not too bad.

I can understand how disappointing the change is for you.\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: Yeah, no kidding. I'm just really upset because this wedding is really important to me. Is there anything you can do to help? Maybe get me on an earlier flight or give me a full refund so I can try to book another airline?

And we're fully booked on that flight as well as others around that time. Let me check if there's any empty seats I can move you to... *more typing* It doesn't look prom-promising to switch your flight right now.

Would seat 12A work for you? That's an aisle seat towards the front of the cabin.\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: Ah yeah, 12A sounds perfect. How much would the change be?\\\\n\\\\nAgent: Let me go ahead and process that seat change for you. The upgrade to 12A would be an additional $75 plus tax.

Was there anything else I can help with today?\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: Actually, yeah one more thing. I have a layover in Denver on the way back from LA. It's only about 2 hours but I was wondering - is there a lounge I could use to relax a bit or grab a snack during the layover?\\\\n\\\\nAgent: Let me check on lounge access for your itinerary. *more typing* It looks like with your United Club membership that comes with your card, you'll have access to the United Club located in concourse A at Denver International. The lounge offers free wifi, snacks, drinks and comfortable seating. It's a great place to relax and recharge between flights.\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: Ah nice, that'll be perfect then.

Umm, let me pull up your reservation and take a look at what happened. *typing noises* Okay, it looks like your first flight was delayed due to severe thunderstorms in the Boston area. The weather caused significant delays for many flights. I can understand why you would be upset about missing your connection.\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: Yeah, it was pouring rain when we finally took off and then we sat on the taxiway for another hour just waiting to get to the gate. By the time I landed in Chicago I only had 20 minutes to catch my flight to LA. Of course naturally it was on the other side of the airport so there was no way I could make it in time. \\\\n\\\\nAgent: Ah I'm really sorry to hear all the details. It sounds like it was just one delay and problem after another for you. Weather is really out of our control unfortunately. Let me see what options I can provide to help make up for the trouble. Since you missed the connecting flight due to the long delay, I can book you on another flight to LA tomorrow at no extra charge. I'll also refund the full amount for the missed leg of the trip from Chicago to LA. Does that help at all?\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: I mean, it helps but now I have to spend another night in Chicago which is really inconvenient. Plus I had plans I was supposed to be in LA for last night. Is there any way you can maybe compensate me for this hotel room and Ubers I've had to take? I spent a lot of extra money because of the delay that wasn't my fault.\\\\n\\\\nAgent: You're absolutely right, I understand this has caused disruption to your plans and unnecessary additional expenses. Let me see what I can do... *typing* It looks like our policy is to provide up to $500 to cover reasonable extra expenses like hotels, meals, transportation when flights are delayed over 5 hours outside the carrier's control. I'd be happy to process a reimbursement for you up to that amount. Could you please email me copies of your receipts for the hotel and Ubers? I'll make sure you're compensated as soon as I receive those. How does that sound?\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: You know what, yeah that actually sounds a lot better. I really appreciate you helping me out with all that. At least this way I shouldn't be completely out of pocket because of your delay. Alright, I'll send over those receipts right after I hang up.

Maybe there's something going to JFK or LaGuardia I could take instead?\\\\n\\\\nAgent: Good thinking, let me check those airports. *typing noises* Okay, if you're open to flying into one of the New York City airports other than Newark, I've got a flight I think will work better for you. There's a flight from Chicago to Denver with a 1 hour and 20 minute layover, then it continues onto JFK. You'd get into JFK only about 45 minutes later than your original arrival time into Newark. How does that sound?\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: Yeah, that works. As long as I'm not going to miss any meetings or anything by getting into JFK instead of Newark, I'll take that. Can you switch me over to that? \\\\n\\\\nAgent: Absolutely, I'm just making the change to your itinerary now. *typing noises* Alright, you're all set with the new itinerary. Your new flight information will be in your email receipt. Is there anything else I can help with today?\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: No, that takes care of it. Thanks for your help!\\\\n\\\\nAgent: You're very welcome, I'm glad we could get you switched to a flight with a longer layover.

If you don't mind me asking, what seems to be the issue with your flight? *papers shuffling in the background*\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: Well the problem is, when I logged onto the United website to check my flight details, it now says the flight is delayed by over 5 hours! I can't believe this, you know how inconvenient this is gonna be for me? I have important plans that I'll now have to cancel or change because of this delay.\\\\n\\\\nAgent: I completely understand your frustration sir. A large delay like that is certainly inconvenient. Umm, may I have your confirmation number so I can pull up your reservation and get some more details on the delay? There's usually backgroun...*phone buzzing* just a second, someone's calling on the other line...ok they hung up, where were we? Right, the confirmation number please. \\\\n\\\\nCustomer: It's PX45E29. And I sure hope you can do something to help, because missing this flight is really going to mess things up for me. Five hours is unacceptable! \\\\n\\\\nAgent: *typing sounds* Okay, let me take a look here...hmm yes I see the delay is due to severe weather that rolled through one of our hubs earlier. Unfortunately there's not much we can do to avoid delays in situations beyond our control like mother nature. But I'll see if there are any alternative flight options we can get you...ahh it looks like the next non-stop isn't until tomorrow evening. Would it be possible for you to reschedule for then instead? I can waive the change fee since this delay was on our end.\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: Tomorrow? Are you kidding me? That's not going to work at all, I have plans I need to get back for. Is there any way you can get me out earlier, even if it means a connecting flight? I really need to fly out today. \\\\n\\\\nAgent: Let me check connecting flights for you. *typing sounds* Okay, it looks like we do have one option that could work better. If you're able to fly out this afternoon, there is a flight with one stop that would get you in only a couple hours later than your original arrival time. The connection would be in Chicago. Would that routing be okay for you today instead?\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: Chicago, ugh that's not ideal but I guess it's better than nothing. What time would the flights be? And is there any way you can compensate me for this massive inconvenience? I know airlines are supposed to put you up in a hotel and things if flights are really delayed.\\\\n\\\\nAgent: The first flight would depart at 1:35pm and get you into Chicago at 3:45pm. Then the connecting flight leaves Chicago at 5:10pm and arrives at your final destination at 7:25pm. As for compensation, let me take a look at our policies for long delays like this...it looks like since the delay was over 3 hours, we are able to provide a $500 travel voucher for you to put towards future travel. I can also reimburse any difference in fare for the alternate itinerary. How does that sound? I'll go ahead and get you rebooked on those flights.\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: *long sigh* Alright, I guess that will have to do. $500 isn't really going to make up for all the changes I now have to make but it's better than nothing. Thank you for at least getting me on those alternative flights today. I appreciate you working with me on this.\\\\n\\\\nAgent: You're very welcome sir, I'm just sorry for all the hassle this delay has caused. Thank you for your patience and for flying with us. I've sent a confirmation email with your new itinerary and travel voucher. Please don't hesitate to reach back out if you need anything else.

Is there any way I can do that? \\\\n\\\\nAgent: Let me take a look at your booking and see what options are available. *typing noises* Okay, it looks like the flight you're currently booked on leaves at 3pm. We do have seats available on an earlier flight that departs at 11am. It would be an $150 change fee to switch your flight. How does that earlier time work for you?\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: Hmm that fee is a bit more than I was expecting. Is there any way you could maybe waive the fee or lower it at all since this is a schedule change on my end? \\\\n\\\\nAgent: I understand the change fee is more than ideal. Let me see if there's anything I can do...*more typing* Unfortunately with it being such a short notice change, I don't have much flexibility with the fee. The best I could do is lower it to $100. Would that work for you still or are you hoping for no fee?\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: Ugh $100 is still pretty steep. *sighs* I guess I don't really have another option since I need to be in LA earlier. Alright, go ahead and switch me to the 11am flight then and charge the $100 fee. \\\\n\\\\nAgent: No problem, I'm happy we could work something out. Just want to double check, you said the 11am flight tomorrow from Chicago to LA?\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: Yes, that's correct.\\\\n\\\\nAgent: Got it, I've gone ahead and processed the change for you.

Is there any way I can switch to an earlier flight? \\\\n\\\\nAgent: Let me check availability for earlier flights on that route. *more typing* Hmm, it looks like the only options I have are either 2 hours earlier or 4 hours later than your original flight time. The earlier flight would require an extra $150 change fee since it's within 7 days. Would you like me to switch you to that one?\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: Ugh $150 is a lot. What if I called back another day, would the fee be less? \\\\n\\\\nAgent: If you call back after your original travel date has passed, then we wouldn't be able to waive the change fee at all since it would then be a cancellation and rebooking. Your best bet would probably be to keep your current flight unless the timing is really not going to work. Ah, let me take a quick look at other dates too in case there's a completely different day that works better for no charge. *typing intensifies* It looks like we have wide open availability the following Monday or Tuesday if you're able to fly then instead.

Is there any way I can change my flight to go to New York tomorrow instead of LA? \\\\n\\\\nAgent: I understand the frustration sir, last minute changes are never ideal. Let me check availability for flights from Chicago to New York tomorrow... *more typing* Unfortunately it looks like that route is fully booked for tomorrow. However, what I can offer is putting you on a flight from Chicago to LaGuardia tomorrow afternoon instead, and then we can get you switched over to a flight from LaGuardia to LA in the evening to hopefully still get you out there the same day. How does that sound?\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: Ugh that's not really any better though, the meeting in New York is actually first thing in the morning. Is there any way I can get a refund or maybe move my LA flight to another day instead? This is really putting me in a bind.\\\\n\\\\nAgent: You're right, I apologize that option doesn't help your schedule for tomorrow either. Let me see what other options we have available... it looks like we may be able to get you fully refunded for the Chicago to LA flight since it's within 24 hours of your travel date. Then you'd be free to book another flight that works better for your schedule. I know it's not ideal to have to rebook last minute, but would a full refund work for you in this situation?\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: Yeah you know what, I think a refund is probably my best option at this point. Can you go ahead and process that for me? I'll start searching for other flight options.\\\\n\\\\nAgent: Absolutely, I've initiated the refund process on our end. It may take a few business days to see the funds back on your original form of payment. In the meantime, feel free to book another flight that will work better for you.

I'm calling because I need to change the dates on my upcoming flight from Chicago to LA.

Can I get your last name and confirmation number please? \\\\n\\\\nCustomer: Sure, last name is Smith and the confirmation number is H456TR3. \\\\n\\\\nAgent: Okay, got it. Let me take a look here... *typing noises* Umm it looks like your flight for this Saturday is fully booked so unfortunately I won't be able to move you to the same flight on a different date. Let me check availability for next Wednesday. *more typing* It looks like there is still space on the 11am flight next Wednesday, would that work for you?\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: Yeah 11am on Wednesday works great. How much would it cost to change the flight? I'm hoping it won't be too expensive since I'm changing it last minute.\\\\n\\\\nAgent: *sighs* I know last minute changes can be costly. Let me take a look at the fare difference here... *typing noises* Okay, so because it's within 7 days of departure the change fee is $200 per ticket. Then the difference in fare between your original Saturday flight and the Wednesday one is an additional $75. So the total to change it would be $200 + $75, coming out to $275. Does that work for you? I know it's not cheap but hopefully it's doable given the situation.\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: Oof, $275 is more than I was expecting. Umm is there any way you could possibly waive the change fee since this is sort of an emergency on my end? It's really pushing my budget and I'd hate to have to cancel if I can't get the fee waived. \\\\n\\\\nAgent: I understand, last minute flight changes are never fun especially when you're working with a tight budget. Let me see what I can do for you... *more typing* So unfortunately I don't have the ability to waive change fees on my end. However, I could put in a request to our exceptions department and see if they would be willing to credit back the $200 fee as a one-time courtesy. I can't guarantee they would approve it but it's worth a shot. Otherwise the other option would be to cancel your flight and forfeit the money from the original booking, then rebook the new flight on Wednesday. But that runs the risk of the Wednesday flight selling out before you can rebook. What would you prefer, putting in the request or cancelling/rebooking?\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: Hmm that's tough. I think let's go ahead and put in the request to waive the fee. I'd hate to lose the original money if the Wednesday flight sells out. Fingers crossed they approve it! And thanks so much for your help, I really appreciate you taking the time to look into options for me.\\\\n\\\\nAgent: You're very welcome, I'm happy to help however I can. Okay, I'm going to go ahead and process the change on our end then submit the request. It may take a day or two to get a response but I'll be sure to call or email you either way.

Is there any way you could possibly fly out on a different day?\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: I don't think so, I really need to be in New York on Wednesday. This is so annoying. Is there a waitlist I can get on in case any seats open up closer to the date?\\\\n\\\\nAgent: Absolutely, I'll go ahead and put you on our waitlist for Wednesday.

We should know within a few days if anything frees up. How's that sound?\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: I guess that's my only choice at this point.

I had to reschedule for today and pay more money.\\\\n\\\\nAgent: Okay, let me take a look here...*typing noises* According to our records, flight 1274 had to be canceled due to severe weather in the Denver area yesterday evening. There was a major snowstorm that rolled through which made the runway conditions unsafe for takeoffs and landings. I'm sorry you hadn't received notification sooner. In situations like that we try to give at least 3 hours notice but sometimes Mother Nature doesn't cooperate. As a gesture of goodwill I've gone ahead and refunded the difference in fare for your new flight today. You should see that credit on your form of payment within the next 7-10 business days.\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: Well that's better than nothing I guess. But it still makes me late getting home! I have kids to take care of, you know. *sighs angrily* This better not happen again or I'm switching airlines, you hear?\\\\n\\\\nAgent: I completely understand your frustration sir. Travel delays are never convenient. Please be assured we do everything we can to operate our flights safely, but inclement weather is sometimes outside of our control. As an apology, I'd like to offer you a $100 voucher for future travel. Hopefully that helps make up for some of the inconvenience. And of course, feel free to choose another carrier if we don't meet your needs going forward. May I ask, how was the rescheduled flight today? Any issues getting to Chicago?\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: The flight today was fine, thank god. Landed on time and everything. *sighs* Alright, I guess I'll take that voucher then. This better not happen again!\\\\n\\\\nAgent: You have my word we'll do everything possible to avoid canceling your flights going forward. Thank you for bearing with us and for being a loyal United customer. I hope the $100 voucher helps make the experience a little less frustrating. You have a good rest of your day sir and safe travels home.\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: Yeah, thanks. You too. *call disconnects* \\\\n\\\\nAgent: Thank you for your call.

Now you were looking to change that flight to Wednesday of next week instead, correct?\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: Yeah that's right. Is there any chance you can do that change for me? I know it's short notice but it would really help me out. \\\\n\\\\nAgent: Let me see what I can do... *more typing* Unfortunately that flight on Wednesday is showing as full so I don't have any seats available to swap you over to that date. I can try to get you on the Thursday flight instead if that might work? Or is the Wednesday date set in stone?\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: Umm Thursday won't really work either unfortunately. Ah man, this is such bad timing. Are there any other options maybe like flying out a different route or something? I'm just really trying to avoid missing this event on Wednesday. \\\\n\\\\nAgent: I understand, that's definitely not ideal. Let me check a few other routes... *keyboard typing intensifies* It looks like I can actually put you on a flight out on Wednesday but you'll have to connect through Denver instead of a direct flight. You'd fly from Chicago to Denver, have a 2 hour layover, and then Denver to LA. Does that work with your schedule or would you really need to be direct?\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: As long as I can get there on Wednesday that connecting flight works for me. What would the cost be to change it over to that? \\\\n\\\\nAgent: Let me take a look at the fare difference... *more typing* Alright, with the change in route the new fare will be an additional $150. Does that work for you? I know it's a bit more but hopefully still better than missing your event.\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: Yeah that's fine, I can do the $150. Can you go ahead and change it over for me then?\\\\n\\\\nAgent: Absolutely, let me just get that processed for you. *typing and clicking noises* Okay, I've got you all switched over to the new itinerary flying out on Wednesday with the connection in Denver. You'll receive an email confirmation shortly. Is there anything else I can help with while you have me?\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: No, I think that covers it. Thank you so much for your help, I really appreciate you getting me on that earlier flight.\\\\n\\\\nAgent: You're very welcome, I'm happy I could work it out for you.

Let me get some more details from you about the bag so I can file a claim. What color is the bag and does it have any identification tags?\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: It's a black duffel bag. There's a red \\\"J.S.\\\" tag attached to the handle. \\\\n\\\\nAgent: Got it. And do you have any idea of the approximate value of the contents? We'll need that to process the claim.\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: *sighs* There were some expensive electronics, clothes, my passport. I'd estimate over $2000 worth of stuff. This is ridiculous, how does an entire bag just disappear?\\\\n\\\\nAgent: I completely understand your frustration, sir. Unfortunately these types of mishandled bags do occur sometimes despite our best efforts. Let me assure you that our priority now is to get your bag located and delivered to you as soon as possible. I'm opening a claim in our system now and the baggage office at O'Hare will be researching the bag's movement. They may need to pull video or talk to ramp agents. We'll also file a trace with our global baggage office. Is the number I have for you the best to reach you at if we have any updates?\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: Yeah, this is my cell. You guys better find my bag soon or reimburse me fully for what was in it. This trip was expensive enough without losing all my stuff. \\\\n\\\\nAgent: I'll make a note of the urgency on the claim. Please know that we will work diligently to search for your bag. If for some reason it cannot be located within 21 days, you will receive reimbursement up to the liability limit without having to submit receipts. I see your itinerary also included a return flight from LA to Chicago next Saturday. Is there anything I can do in terms of rebooking you or providing compensation for essentials until your bag is recovered?\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: You can put me on the earliest available flight back tomorrow. And I need money for clothes and toiletries for now - how do I file to get that?\\\\n\\\\nAgent: Okay, let me check availability for tomorrow. The earliest flight I see leaves LAX at 7am and will have you back in Chicago by 2pm. I'll go ahead and rebook you on that at no additional charge. As for essentials reimbursement, I'm going to email you a Lost Bag Replacement Form. Fill it out with the items you purchase and receipts, scan and email it back to me. Once I receive it, I can process up to $500 in reimbursement on my end without additional review. Please keep the original receipts in case of an audit. Does this help in the meantime until we can find your bag?\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: I guess that will have to do. Just please find my bag, okay? This is the worst travel experience I've ever had. \\\\n\\\\nAgent: I truly apologize again for the inconvenience. Please be assured that we are making every effort to locate your bag as quickly as possible. Feel free to contact me directly if you have any other questions - my name and extension are on the confirmation I'm emailing you now.

Let me check other carriers and see if I can find you an alternate route. *phone static* Unfortunately it looks like everything is delayed or sold out due to the weather. Most passengers are being rerouted for tomorrow. However, I do see there is one option--I can put you on American Airlines leaving later tonight at 10:30pm and getting you into New York around 1am. You'd need to recheck your bag but at least you'd arrive the same night.\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: Ugh, getting in at 1am is still going to mess everything up for Monday.

This stupid pandemic has messed everything up.\\\\n\\\\nAgent: I understand your frustration with the ongoing situation. What flight were you looking to change? *typing noises* Let me pull up your reservation.\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: It's from Chicago to Seattle, leaving on the 15th. I was supposed to visit some family but now it doesn't look like that's going to happen. \\\\n\\\\nAgent: Okay, let me take a look here... *pause as agent reviews reservation details* Unfortunately that route is booking up fast for those dates. It looks like the closest availability I have is to push your flight back by a week, leaving on the 22nd instead. Would that work with your schedule or do you need an earlier date?\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: Ugh that's later than I was hoping for. Is there really nothing earlier? This is so annoying, I just want to know if I should even bother with the trip at this point.\\\\n\\\\nAgent: I understand your frustration, it's never fun having to change travel plans. Let me try searching some alternate airports near Chicago in case we can find you an earlier connection. *typing and mouse clicking noises* Unfortunately O'Hare and Midway are both fully booked for the dates you need. How about if I looked at flying into Milwaukee instead? They have a flight leaving on the 18th that may work.\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: Milwaukee? That's like two hours from where I need to be. This is ridiculous. I'm never flying United again, you guys always do this to me. Can't you bump someone else and put me on that original flight?\\\\n\\\\nAgent: I apologize for the inconvenience, sir. I know changing plans can be difficult. Unfortunately we are unable to bump another passenger without their consent. Let me check one more option... It looks like if you're willing to fly into Rockford instead, there is availability on a flight leaving on the 17th and connecting through Denver. I could book you on that if you're open to the additional drive from Rockford? Otherwise the 22nd is really the earliest I have straight to Seattle.\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: Ugh, fine. Book me on the Rockford flight then. I really don't want to have to wait another week. This is such a pain. Make sure you skip the fees for changing it since you guys are the ones who messed me up here!\\\\n\\\\nAgent: I completely understand your frustration with the change. Let me go ahead and process that new itinerary for you through Rockford on the 17th. I see you booked the original flight as non-refundable so unfortunately I am unable to waive change fees in this case. But let me apply a $100 flight credit to your account to help offset the cost. Does that work for you?\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: A hundred bucks, that's it? This is costing me way more than that to have to rent a car and drive from Rockford. You guys are unbelievable. \\\\n\\\\nAgent: I apologize sir, $100 is the maximum flight credit I'm able to offer in a situation like this. I know it doesn't fully make up for the inconvenience. Please let me know if I can assist with anything else on the new itinerary today. Otherwise, I hope you have a safe trip and things work out with your family visit.\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: Whatever, thanks I guess.

Is there any way you can help me out here and reduce that fee at all? Money is pretty tight right now. \\\\n\\\\nAgent: Ah I apologize for the inconvenience. Let me go ahead and take a look at the circumstances and see if there's anything I can do on my end to help lower that fee for you. *puts customer on brief hold* Okay, I was able to get your fee down to $100 since this is the second change. Will that work a little better for your situation?\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: You know, $100 is still a lot for me right now but I really need to change this flight. Alright, I'll go ahead and pay the $100 fee. Thank you for trying to get it lower - I appreciate the help. Can you go ahead and switch me over to the 10am flight?\\\\n\\\\nAgent: You're very welcome, I'm glad we could work together to find a solution.

What's the last name the reservation is under?\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: It's booked under Johnson. Flight number is UA108, departing Chicago at 1:30pm.\\\\n\\\\nAgent: Okay, let me pull that up... *typing noises* Alright, I've got the reservation here for James Johnson on flight UA108 from Chicago to LA next Tuesday departing at 1:30pm. What specifics did you need to check on the booking?\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: I just wanted to confirm how many bags I'm allowed to check and also if the seats I selected are still available. I booked a couple months ago so I want to make sure nothing has changed.\\\\n\\\\nAgent: No worries, let me take a look... It looks like with your ticket you're allowed to check up to two bags free of charge. As for the seats, you had selected seats 12A and 12B. Those seats are still available and assigned to you, so you're all set there. Is there anything else I can check on the reservation for you today?\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: That's great, thanks for confirming all that for me. I really appreciate you taking the time. One other thing - I have United Miles that I earned from past flights. Will those miles expire anytime soon?\\\\n\\\\nAgent: You're very welcome, I'm glad I could help reassure you about the details. Let me pull up your MileagePlus account real quick... *more typing noises* Okay, it looks like you have a balance of 15,000 miles that won't expire until January 2024. The miles expiration policy for United is 18 months from the time you earn them or take an eligible trip, so you're all set there too. Does that help answer your question about the miles?\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: Perfect, that's really helpful to know. Thanks so much Sam, I think that covers everything I needed to check on.

Alright, it looks like you are correct, that flight was changed from a 7pm departure to a 5pm.

However, I do see we have some seats left on the 9pm flight that day. Would moving you to that flight work instead?\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: Hmm the 9pm flight would be pretty late getting into LA. Any chance there's something earlier? I have an early meeting the next day that I'd like to get a decent night's sleep before. \\\\n\\\\nAgent: I understand, arriving late is never ideal. Just one second, let me check a few other possibilities... *typing noises* Okay, it looks like we have two seats open on the 6:30pm flight. Would that work a little better for your schedule? It would still get you into LA earlier than the 9pm flight.\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: Yeah, 6:30 would be much better. As long as it doesn't cost any more to switch to that one? Money's a bit tight these days, you know?\\\\n\\\\nAgent: No problem, I completely understand. Since this is a schedule change on our end, I'll be able to switch you over to the 6:30pm flight at no additional cost.

However, I do see that there is still availability on the 9am flight. Would switching to that time work for your schedule? There would be a $75 change fee to process the update.\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: Hmm, the 9am flight might work actually. Do you think I'd have enough time to make my meeting if the flight lands at 11:15am? I'd hate to pay the change fee if it doesn't really help. \\\\n\\\\nAgent: I understand the hesitation with the fee. Let me pull up the flight times and transit options from the airport into Manhattan. *typing again* Okay, so the 9am flight is scheduled to land at 11:15am at Newark Airport. From there, the train into Penn Station takes about 30 minutes. You should have no problem making your 2pm meeting as long as everything runs on time.

How can I help you today?\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: Hi, I'm calling because my last flight from Chicago to New York was a complete nightmare. The flight was super delayed, we sat on the tarmac for over 2 hours! Then when we finally took off, they ran out of food halfway through the flight. It was awful.\\\\n\\\\nAgent: I'm sorry to hear about your poor experience. Delays and running out of supplies are never acceptable. May I have your record locator or confirmation number so I can pull up the details of your flight? There seems to be some noise, let me just see if I can hear you better. *pause, background noise decreases* Okay, please provide your record locator when you're ready.\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: Yeah the flight was last Thursday, record locator is HXV4N2. I paid a lot of money for my ticket and this is unacceptable customer service. I want to know what United is going to do for me for having to deal with such a nightmare of a flight. \\\\n\\\\nAgent: Give me just a moment to look up the details of your flight with that record locator...okay, I see it was flight 1564 from Chicago to New York on May 5th that arrived over 3 hours late. Umm, let me take a look at the reasons for the delay. It looks like there was severe weather in both Chicago and New York that day which caused multiple flights to be diverted and delayed. I completely understand your frustration with the long wait on the tarmac and running out of food. In situations out of our control like weather, all I can say is I apologize for the poor experience. As a goodwill gesture for the delay and issues, I'd be happy to provide you with a $300 travel credit to put towards a future United flight. Does that seem fair to you?\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: $300? Are you kidding me? That flight cost over $500 total and I lost a whole day of work because of the delay! I want a full refund and some extra compensation for my trouble. This is unacceptable customer service.\\\\n\\\\nAgent: You're right, I understand this was a major inconvenience that caused you financial problems as well. Let me see what else I can offer. *typing sounds* Okay, because of the length of the delay and overall poor experience, I'm authorized to give you a full refund of the $524 ticket cost. I'll also apply an additional $200 travel credit to your account. The total value of $724 should more than make up for your lost day of work and trouble with this flight. Please let me know if this new offer seems fair to resolve your issue. I'm hoping we can part on good terms moving forward.\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: You know, I'm still not happy but I guess $724 back is better than nothing. This better not happen again next time I fly United. You guys really dropped the ball on this one. \\\\n\\\\nAgent: I completely understand your frustration and thank you for being willing to accept this resolution. Please be assured we will learn from this experience and work to improve our operations and customer service. Flying should be a pleasant one, so I appreciate you bringing this issue to our attention. Enjoy your future travels, and if there's anything else I can do for you today please let me know.

Air travel has become more complex as routes have increased over the years. With more connections come more opportunities for delays or mishandling to unfortunately occur.

Your website shouldn't let me try to change it if it's not actually possible. *long sigh* I guess I don't really have a choice, do I? Fine, switch me to the 10:30 flight. But I better get some miles or voucher or something for this hassle.\\\\n\\\\nAgent: I understand your frustration sir. Unfortunately those are the policies with any flight changes within the cancellation window. Let me see what I can do for you though...*more typing* Okay, I've gone ahead and updated your reservation to the 10:30am flight next Wednesday. And as an apology for the trouble, I'm also adding 5,000 bonus miles to your account you can use on a future trip. Will that work for you?\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: 5,000 miles is nothing. This whole thing has been a nightmare. Your website sucks, your change policies suck. You guys really need to improve your customer service. \\\\n\\\\nAgent: You're definitely right that the experience could have been smoother. I'm sorry this caused you so much trouble. As a show of good faith, let me see if I can do a little better on those bonus miles for you. *typing* Alright, I've added 15,000 bonus miles instead. And if there's any other issues at all with this new flight, please don't hesitate to call back and I'll do my best to help make it right. Does that sound acceptable?\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: I guess it will have to do. Thanks John.\\\\n\\\\nAgent: You're very welcome sir, and thank you for flying United. I hope the rest of your trip goes smoothly. You have a good one.\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: Yep, bye. *hangs up*\\\\n\\\\nAgent: *sighs* Thank goodness that one's over.

How may I help you today?\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: Hi, yeah I'm calling because my flight from Chicago to New York tomorrow keeps getting delayed. This is the third time it's been pushed back and now it leaves 6 hours later than originally scheduled. I'm really frustrated at this point.\\\\n\\\\nAgent: I completely understand your frustration sir. Delays and schedule changes are never fun. Let me take a look at your itinerary and see what's going on with that flight. What's the confirmation number?\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: It's UA1245. Please tell me there's something you can do, I have meetings in New York I really can't miss. \\\\n\\\\nAgent: *typing sounds* Okay, I see the issue here. That flight has been experiencing major delays due to weather in Chicago. There was ice on the runways that prevented many flights from taking off on time. I'm really sorry about this. Let me see if there are any options to get you there sooner. Hmm...the next direct flight to New York leaves in 2 hours, but it's fully booked. Would you consider flying into Newark instead and taking the train into the city? That flight is on time.\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: Ugh, Newark? *sighs* I guess that's better than sitting in the airport all day. What time would I get into the city if I did that?\\\\n\\\\nAgent: Let me check the train schedule...if you can make that flight to Newark, you'd land at 3:15pm. The train from Newark Penn Station to New York Penn Station only takes about 25-30 minutes. So you'd get into Manhattan around 3:45pm. Does that work with your meetings or do you need to be there even sooner?\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: 3:45 might work, but it's cutting it close. And what if the train is delayed too? I just feel like I'm taking a big risk changing plans last minute. There really isn't anything else you can do like put me on a different airline or something?\\\\n\\\\nAgent: I understand the risk of changing plans last minute makes you uncomfortable. Let me check one more option...umm *typing* it looks like we have two seats left on an American Airlines flight leaving for LaGuardia in an hour. It would get you into NYC at 2:15pm. Would you prefer to take that flight instead? I can easily switch your booking over.\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: Oh thank god, yes that would be so much better. You have no idea how stressed I've been about this. I really appreciate you finding that other flight for me.\\\\n\\\\nAgent: I'm happy I could help resolve this stressful situation for you. One moment while I process the booking change to American. *typing sounds* Okay sir, you're all set on the new flight. The confirmation number is AA5294. Please let me know if you need anything else. And I do apologize again for all the delays and changes with your original United flight. I hope the rest of your travel goes smoother.\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: Thanks so much, you've been really helpful. I'll be sure to request a refund or credit for the problems with United as well. Have a good one!\\\\n\\\\nAgent: You're very welcome. Enjoy your time in New York and good luck with your meetings!

Your flight from Chicago to San Francisco is scheduled to depart at 7:15am next Tuesday from O'Hare. Does that sound correct?\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: Hmm, yeah that sounds right. Umm, actually while I have you on the line there was one other thing. I was hoping to change my return flight from a Wednesday to a Monday instead. Would that be possible?\\\\n\\\\nAgent: Let me take a look at availability for the Monday you're looking to return. *typing noises* Okay, it looks like we do have seats available on the flight leaving San Francisco and arriving back in Chicago at 5:30pm on that Monday. It would be a $75 change fee to move your return date. How does that work for you?\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: Ah man, $75 is a little more than I was hoping to pay. Any chance you could waive the fee since I'm changing it so far in advance? Money is a bit tight right now. \\\\n\\\\nAgent: I understand the frustration with change fees, believe me. *sighs* Unfortunately with it being so close to the travel date there's not much flexibility on my end to waive fees. The best I could maybe do is credit your account for $25 to put towards future travel. Does that help at all?\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: You know, $25 is better than nothing I suppose. Alright, go ahead and switch my return date then please. And thank you for trying to work with me on the fee. I appreciate it.\\\\n\\\\nAgent: No problem, I'm happy I could help get you that partial credit. Just give me one moment to process the change...okay, all set!

May I have your confirmation number or last name so I can pull up your reservation? *typing noises* Okay, got it here. What exactly happened with the delay on that flight?\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: Well when we got to the airport everything was fine, we went through security and all that with no issues. But then when we got to the gate they kept saying the flight was delayed, first it was 30 minutes then an hour, then another hour. There was just no communication about what was actually going on. We were sitting at the gate for over 3 hours! \\\\n\\\\nAgent: Oh wow, that is definitely a long delay. Umm, let me take a look at the flight details here...it looks like there was a mechanical issue with the plane that caused the multiple delays. The maintenance crew was working to fix an engine problem but it took longer than expected. I completely understand your frustration with the lack of communication during that time, that is never ideal for passengers.\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: Yeah, it was really annoying. Especially since we had plans when we landed and everything got all messed up because of the delay. Is there anything United can do as compensation? We missed our dinner reservations and had to get a hotel last minute since it was so late when we finally took off.\\\\n\\\\nAgent: Absolutely, I apologize for the poor experience. Let me see what options we have for compensation. *more typing* It looks like due to the lengthy delay being caused by a mechanical issue, you are eligible for a refund of 75% of the original fare. I can process that refund for you now. In addition, I'll also add a $300 travel credit to your United frequent flyer account that can be used for future travel. Will that help make up for the inconvenience?\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: Yeah, that sounds reasonable I suppose. As long as you guys can get me home on time next week! I have another flight booked back and I don't want a repeat of last time. \\\\n\\\\nAgent: I completely understand your concern about your return flight. Let me take a quick look at that reservation as well. *more typing* That flight is scheduled to depart on time next Thursday at 11am. Of course, things can come up, but I don't see any issues forecasted at this point. Please feel free to contact me directly if there are any delays or changes to that flight, I'll do my best to re-accommodate you. How does that sound?\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: Alright, that makes me feel a bit better. As long as you take care of the refund and credit like you said. I appreciate you helping to fix this, Tammy. \\\\n\\\\nAgent: You're very welcome, I'm happy I could help resolve this situation. Thank you for your patience and for flying with United.

Can you go ahead and switch it over to that Friday for me then please?\\\\n\\\\nAgent: Absolutely, let me go ahead and process that change for you. I'll just need to read back the new itinerary details and take a payment over the phone. Your new flight will depart on Friday, May 15th. The flight is United flight 127 leaving at 9:35am from Chicago and arriving in Denver at 11:15am. Then your return flight on Tuesday, May 19th is United flight 305 departing Denver at 4:15pm and arriving back in Chicago at 7:05pm. Does this all look correct?\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: Yep, that all looks right to me. Go ahead and take the payment over the phone so I can get this changed.\\\\n\\\\nAgent: Great, just one moment while I process the payment... *typing and clicking noises* Alright, I've processed the $150 change fee on the credit card we have on file. Your flight is now updated to the new dates. You'll receive an email confirmation shortly. Thank you for flying with United and I hope you have a good rest of your trip!\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: Thank you so much for your help, I appreciate you getting that changed for me.

My name is John.\\\\n\\\\nAgent: Sure, no problem John. What flight are you booked on? Let me pull up your reservation. *typing noises* OK, I've found your reservation. What questions did you have?\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: Well ahh, I was hoping to change the date of my flight. The thing is something came up at work and I need to fly out a day earlier. Is there any way to do that without paying a change fee?\\\\n\\\\nAgent: I understand, things come up unexpectedly with work sometimes. Let me take a look at the availability and fees for changing your flight. *more typing* Unfortunately that flight is pretty full for the day before and we don't have any open seats. Even if we did, there would be a change fee of $150 plus any difference in fare. Does flying out a day later work or is the earlier date absolutely necessary for your work trip?\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: No flying out later won't work unfortunately. Hmm $150 is a lot, is there any way you could waive that fee just this once? Maybe because I'm a frequent flyer with you guys? \\\\n\\\\nAgent: I understand the fee is steep. Let me take a look at your loyalty status and see if there's anything I can do. *more typing* It looks like you do fly with us regularly so I'll go ahead and waive the change fee just this one time as a courtesy. However, if flying out a day earlier means a higher fare, you'll have to pay the difference. Does that work for you?\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: Oh wow, thank you so much I really appreciate you waiving the fee. Let me check the fare difference... *pause as customer checks phone* Okay it looks like it's only $50 more to fly out the day before. I can definitely do that then. Can you switch my flight for me?\\\\n\\\\nAgent: You're very welcome, I'm glad I could help! Yes, I'll get that changed over for you right now. *typing noises* Okay, all set! Your new flight information will be in your email receipt. Thank you for being a loyal United customer and for your patience today. Please let me know if there's anything else I can help with before we finish up.\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: No that's perfect, thank you so much for your help Sam I really appreciate you taking the time to switch my flight.

I need to change it to this coming Thursday instead.\\\\n\\\\nAgent: Let me take a look and see what options are available for that Thursday... *typing sounds* okay it looks like we have seats available on the 11:30am flight from Chicago to Denver on Thursday. How does that work for your schedule?\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: Yeah Thursday at 11:30 works fine. What's the cost to change it? I'm hoping it doesn't involve having to pay the difference in fare.\\\\n\\\\nAgent: Let me check the fare rules for your ticket... *more typing* unfortunately because it's within the 7 day window prior to departure, there will be a change fee of $150 plus any difference in fare. The Thursday flight is $50 more than what you originally paid. So the total to change it would be $150 change fee plus $50 fare difference for a total of $200.\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: Ugh, $200 to change it? That's ridiculous. Is there any way you can waive the change fee? This came up at the last minute for work so it's not like I'm trying to change it for no good reason.\\\\n\\\\nAgent: I understand the frustration sir, unfortunately with booked fares that close to departure our hands are tied as far as waiving change fees. We do have policies in place to protect the fare rates. However, maybe there's another option we could look at instead of a change. Would you consider cancelling this flight and rebooking the new travel instead? There would be a $150 cancellation fee but you could rebook the new travel at the currently published fare which may end up being cheaper overall.\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: Hmm okay, let me think about that for a minute... *20 second pause* yeah you know what, let's just go ahead and cancel this one and rebook me on that Thursday flight instead. At least that way I'm not getting hit with both a change fee and fare increase.\\\\n\\\\nAgent: No problem, I'm happy to help you with that. Just give me one moment to process the cancellation... *typing sounds* alright your original flight is now cancelled. When I search the Thursday flight the current fare is only $25 more than your original fare was. So your total to rebook that flight would be the $150 cancellation fee plus the $25 additional fare for a total of $175. Does that work for you?\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: Yeah, $175 is much better than $200. Okay, go ahead and book me on that Thursday flight then. \\\\n\\\\nAgent: Will do! Just need to get some updated payment information from you to complete the new booking. What credit card would you like to use for the $175?\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: Okay, you can use the Visa ending in 4567, expiration is 03/24.\\\\n\\\\nAgent: Great, thank you. *typing sounds* Alright sir, you are all set with your new itinerary flying out on this coming Thursday instead of Tuesday.

I'm gonna miss my meeting now.\\\\n\\\\nAgent: Okay, let me pull up your reservation. *typing sounds* Okay, I see your flight here. The original departure time was 11am but it's now been pushed back to 2pm due to maintenance issues on the aircraft. I apologize for the inconvenience. Let me see what options we have to get you there on time. Umm...it looks like the next direct flight to LA leaves at 1pm, I could switch you over to that one no problem. Unfortunately it's the last direct flight of the day. Would that work?\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: No that won't work, my meeting is at 12:30. Is there any way you can get me there sooner on a different airline? I know it's last minute but this is really important.\\\\n\\\\nAgent: Ah I understand, missing your meeting wouldn't be ideal. Let me check some other airline options for you. Hmm...the soonest departing flight I see on another carrier is an American Airlines flight that leaves at 11:30am and would get you into LAX by 1:15pm. I could book you on that one instead but you would need to get to the other terminal. I'll have to charge you the difference in fare but I'll waive the change fee. Does that work?\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: Ugh, yeah I guess that'll have to do. I really didn't want to have to rush to a different terminal but if it's the only way to make my meeting then fine. How much more is it going to cost me?\\\\n\\\\nAgent: *typing sounds* Okay, looks like the fare difference is $150 plus taxes. I'll go ahead and process the booking change for you now and get you all switched over. Just be sure to allow extra time to get to the American terminal as security lines can be long. Your new confirmation number is DWQ3R1. Does that work for you?\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: $150?! That's ridiculous, your delay is going to make me late and now you're charging me more. That's unacceptable. Is there anything else you can do? I'm a very loyal United customer and have status, can't you give me any kind of credit or voucher for the next time?\\\\n\\\\nAgent: I apologize for the additional cost sir, I know changing plans last minute is frustrating. As a gesture of goodwill, let me check what other options I might be able to offer. You said you have elite status with us? *typing sounds* Okay, as a Platinum member I see you've accrued $200 in future travel credits. I'm going to apply that credit to your booking today to cover the difference in fare. You should see the credit on your account now. I hope this helps make the situation a bit better. Please let me know if there's anything else I can do for you today.\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: All right, I guess that will have to do then. Thanks for getting me switched over last minute. Just really disappointed with the whole experience today. \\\\n\\\\nAgent: I completely understand your frustration sir. Delays are never ideal but I'm glad we were able to get you booked on the earlier American flight. Please accept my apologies again for any inconvenience. I hope the rest of your travels go smoothly. Thanks for being a loyal United customer and have a good rest of your day.\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: Yeah, you too. *call disconnects*\\\\n\\\\nAgent: Thank you for calling United Airlines, have a good day. *call ends*\", 360.0, 600.0, 413148, \"neutral\", \"angry\", -0.14, 0.19, \"Seating\", \"Andrew Valentine\", 0.0], [6085386911, 3115467713, 384932, \"2024-08-31 23:43:00\", \"2024-08-31 23:50:00\", \"2024-09-01 00:10:00\", \"\\\\n\\\\nAgent: Thank you for calling United Airlines, my name is Sam. How can I help you today?\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: Hi Sam, thanks for taking my call. I'm calling about a flight I booked from Chicago to Los Angeles last month. The flight was delayed by over 3 hours and I missed my connecting flight.\\\\n\\\\nAgent: I'm sorry to hear about that delay, umm let me pull up your record here. What's the name the booking was made under?\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: The name is John Smith. The original flight was scheduled to depart on July 15th at 10am from Chicago to LA.\\\\n\\\\nAgent: Okay, let me see... *typing sounds* Yep, I've got your booking here John. It looks like your first flight did experience a significant delay, arriving in LA at 1:23pm instead of the original arrival time of 11:50am. That's unfortunate but these things do sometimes happen unfortunately. Since you missed your connecting flight due to the delay, what would you like me to do for you today?\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: *sighs* Yeah it was really frustrating missing that meeting. Ahmm is there any way I could get a refund for the missed connection? Or even just a travel credit to use for future flights? \\\\n\\\\nAgent: I understand your frustration, travel delays are never fun. Let me take a look at our policies... *more typing* It looks like since the delay was due to weather and outside of our control, we may not be able to offer a full refund. However, I'd be happy to credit your account with $150 that you can use for travel within the next year to make up for the troubles. How does that sound?\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: Hmm that does sound better than nothing I suppose. Alright, I'll take the $150 travel credit then. At least it'll cover my next flight. Thanks for your help Sam, I appreciate you taking the time to look into this for me.\\\\n\\\\nAgent: You're very welcome, I'm glad we could find a solution. Thank you for flying with United, even if this one trip didn't go exactly as planned. I've added the $150 travel credit to your account and you should see it there within the next 24 hours.

How may I help you today?\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: Hi Sam, I'm calling because I'm having a problem with a flight I booked. Umm, my flight from Chicago to Los Angeles is tomorrow morning but it looks like it's been delayed by a few hours. \\\\n\\\\nAgent: I see, thanks for letting me know. Can I get your confirmation number so I can take a look at your reservation?\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: Yeah, it's XF63729. *rustling sounds as customer finds paper* Uhh, hold on a second... okay, got it, XF63729.\\\\n\\\\nAgent: *typing sounds* Okay, let me pull that up... alright, it looks like your flight from Chicago to LA has been delayed until the afternoon due to some weather issues in Chicago. The new departure time is 2:15pm. I'm sorry for the change and any inconvenience this causes. \\\\n\\\\nCustomer: Ugh, are you serious? Another delay? This is the third time this flight has been changed. I have important meetings in LA tomorrow that I can't miss. Is there anything else you can do, like put me on a different flight or offer a refund? I'm getting really frustrated with United at this point. \\\\n\\\\nAgent: I completely understand your frustration, sir. Let me take a look at some other options for you. *typing sounds* Unfortunately all the other nonstop flights from Chicago to LA are fully booked for tomorrow. However, I do have availability to reroute you through Denver, leaving in about an hour. You'd have a short layover there and then continue on to LA, arriving around 10pm. I can go ahead and switch your booking to that itinerary at no additional cost. As for a refund, since this delay was due to weather and therefore out of our control, I unfortunately can't offer one in this case. But let me know if you'd like me to change your flight to the alternate route going through Denver today.\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: Ugh, 10pm gets me in way too late. Any earlier flights available the next day? This delay is going to make me miss a really important meeting tomorrow that I was supposed to present at. \\\\n\\\\nAgent: Ah, let me check flights for the following day. *typing and mouse clicking sounds* It looks like we have a direct flight leaving Chicago at 7am and arriving in LA at 10am the next day. Would that work better for your schedule? As an apology for the multiple delays, I can go ahead and switch your flight to that one free of charge. \\\\n\\\\nCustomer: Yeah, that 7am flight works much better. At least I'll make my meeting then. This really has been a nightmare of a trip so far though, between all the delays and changes. \\\\n\\\\nAgent: I completely understand your frustration sir. Thank you for your patience - I can only imagine how stressful this has been. Go ahead and use the flight credits I'm issuing you today towards future travel as well. And please let me know if there's anything else I can do for you in the meantime. I've made the changes in our system and you're all set on the 7am flight tomorrow. Thank you again for flying with us.\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: Okay, thanks I appreciate you helping to fix this. *sighs* Hopefully no more issues tomorrow.\\\\n\\\\nAgent: You're very welcome, and I hope you have a smooth flight then.

Do you have anything around 7 or 8am?\\\\n\\\\nAgent: Let me check the flight options for that day. *more typing* It looks like we have a flight departing at 7:15am that would get you into San Francisco at 8:45am. We also have an 8:05am flight with an arrival time of 9:35am.

Is it possible to fly out on Tuesday instead maybe?\\\\n\\\\nAgent: Sure, let me look at Tuesday flights as well. *more keyboard clicks* Unfortunately the Tuesday flights are both later in the day, the first one doesn't depart until 11am. Would you like me to go ahead and switch you to the 8:05am flight on Wednesday? There would be a $75 change fee applied.\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: Ah man $75 is a bit more than I was wanting to pay just for a few hours difference. *sighs* I guess I'll just stick with the original 10am flight on Wednesday then. Thanks for checking Steve.\\\\n\\\\nAgent: No problem, I'm sorry we couldn't find an earlier flight that worked better for you without the change fee.

I had to fill out all these forms and wait around for over an hour just to report it. No one could tell me where it was or when I would get it back.

I had work clothes, toiletries, everything in there that I needed. \\\\n\\\\nAgent: I completely understand your frustration with that situation, having your bags lost can really disrupt your travel plans. I apologize for the poor experience. In regards to cancelling next week's flight, if I process a full refund for you will that help resolve the issue?

Will you guys do anything to prevent this from happening to someone else? \\\\n\\\\nAgent: You're right to still be upset after what happened. I can assure you that we are working hard to improve our baggage systems to minimize mishandled bags. As a courtesy, let me also credit your account with a $100 travel voucher that can be used on a future United flight. Does that help show our commitment to regaining your trust? \\\\n\\\\nCustomer: Umm I guess the travel voucher is better than nothing. Alright fine, go ahead and give me the full refund then. I just hope I don't have to deal with lost luggage again if I do end up booking with you guys in the future. This really left a bad taste in my mouth.\\\\n\\\\nAgent: I completely understand, losing a bag is never okay and reflects poorly on our service. Thank you for giving us another chance.

I can switch your reservation to that flight at no additional cost since it's within 24 hours of your original travel time. How does that sound?\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: Ugh are you kidding me? A 8 hour delay? That's going to mess up my whole day. And I bet you that flight will probably be delayed too, it always is with you guys.

Let me check a few other options though...*more typing* Unfortunately the morning and afternoon flights are all booked up. I could try to put you on standby for an earlier flight if any seats open up, but there are no guarantees. Would you like me to switch you to the 6pm or keep your original 10am time and you could try to change your meeting?\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: This is ridiculous. I spend all this money on these tickets and you can't even get me where I need to go at a decent time. You know what, just cancel the whole thing, I'll fly another airline. How do I get a refund?\\\\n\\\\nAgent: I understand your frustration sir. While I can't guarantee an earlier flight time, let me see what options we might have to assist you further. *typing* It looks like we may be able to get you most of your money back if you cancel the reservation since it's more than a week out. However, since our fares are non-refundable there would be a $150 cancellation fee per ticket. Would you still like me to process the cancellation? I'm more than happy to try and find another solution as well if you give me a few more minutes.\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: A $150 fee? Are you joking? This is such a racket. You guys book all the flights up so people can't change their plans and then charge them extra when you can't deliver. I want the full refund, no fee. Connect me to a supervisor.\\\\n\\\\nAgent: I understand your frustration sir, but unfortunately I don't have the ability to waive fees on cancellations. May I try one more option before I transfer you? Let me check about moving your flight to a different day near the original travel time. Maybe we have more availability on say Thursday or Friday that could work better for your schedule. *more typing* It looks like we have wide open availability on Friday departing at 1pm, I could switch you to that flight at no cost. Would Friday work better for your travel plans? I'm happy to keep looking as well if not.\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: Ugh, Friday isn't really any better because I still have meetings that whole day. You know what, forget it. Just do the refund with the stupid $150 fee, I give up. This was the worst customer service ever.\\\\n\\\\nAgent: I'm sorry to hear we couldn't find an ideal solution for your travel change today sir. Let me go ahead and process that cancellation then. The refund should be back on your original form of payment within 7-10 business days minus the $150 fee per ticket. Thank you for flying with us and I apologize again for any inconvenience. Please feel free to reach back out if you do decide to book with us again in the future.\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: Yeah, don't count on it.

How can I help you today?\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: Hi Dave, yeah I'm calling in about a flight I have booked from Chicago to London next Friday. \\\\n\\\\nAgent: Okay, no problem. What would you like to know about that flight?\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: Well, I got an email the other day saying there was a schedule change. The departure time got moved up by two hours. That's going to cause me some issues with plans I had on the other end. \\\\n\\\\nAgent: I understand, schedule changes can definitely throw a wrench in your plans. Let me pull up your reservation and take a look at what happened with that flight. *typing sounds* Okay, it looks like due to some aircraft maintenance issues, they had to swap planes and that required adjusting the departure time. Umm... let me see what options we might have for you to either get on an alternate flight or get some compensation for the change. *more typing* It looks like we do have another flight departing around the original time, would moving you to that one work better?\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: Yeah, that sounds like it would work a lot better for me actually. As long as it doesn't cost anything extra to switch over to that flight.\\\\n\\\\nAgent: No problem, I can switch you over to that flight at no additional cost since this was a schedule change initiated by us. Just give me one second to process that for you...*typing*...okay, you're all set on the new flight! The departure time is only about 20 minutes different than your original. I've also added a $100 travel voucher to your account for any future flights as an apology for the inconvenience. Please let me know if you have any other questions!\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: Oh wow, thanks so much for your help Dave I really appreciate you getting me switched over to that better flight and the travel voucher too. That's really good customer service. \\\\n\\\\nAgent: You're very welcome, I'm happy I could help smooth things over for your travel plans. Enjoy your trip to London! United aims to provide great service like this to all our customers. Please feel free to contact us again if any other issues come up.

How can I help you today?\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: Hi, yeah I'm calling because I'm really not happy with my recent flight. The flight was delayed for over 3 hours and I missed an important meeting because of it. \\\\n\\\\nAgent: I'm sorry to hear about the long delay, that's definitely frustrating. Can you tell me the flight details so I can take a look?\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: It was flight 1938 from Chicago to New York last Wednesday. We were supposed to take off at 3pm but we didn't get in the air until after 6!\\\\n\\\\nAgent: Let me pull up the details for that flight...okay yeah I see it here. There was a major storm moving through the area that afternoon which caused significant delays. Unfortunately weather is beyond our control but I understand how disappointing it was to miss your meeting. Umm... *sound of typing* it looks like we did provide passengers with snacks and drinks during the delay but that probably didn't make up for the hassle. What would you like me to do to help make this right? \\\\n\\\\nCustomer: I want a full refund for the flight. Three hours is unacceptable, and now I've lost business because of it. This is the last time I'm flying United.\\\\n\\\\nAgent: I can certainly understand your frustration, sir. Let me take a look at refund options for you. *more typing sounds* Unfortunately since the delay was due to severe weather, our policy is that no refunds are provided. However, I'd be happy to provide you with a $200 travel voucher to put towards your next United flight. Will that work for you? I know it doesn't make up for missing your meeting but hopefully it helps make the experience a bit better.\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: Are you kidding me? $200 is nothing, that flight cost over $500! I want half my money back at minimum. This is ridiculous customer service.\\\\n\\\\nAgent: You're right, I apologize sir, $200 is not very much given the expense of the ticket. Let me see if my supervisor will approve a larger refund. One moment please while I speak with them... *holds line for 30 seconds* Okay, after discussing with my supervisor, we've agreed to refund you 50% of the ticket price due to the significant delay and the impact it had. I've processed a refund of $250 back to your original form of payment. Does that seem fair to you?\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: I guess $250 is better than nothing. This better not happen again though - you guys really dropped the ball on this one. \\\\n\\\\nAgent: I understand your frustration and thank you for your patience. We aim to get customers to their destinations on time, and unfortunately weather doesn't always cooperate. Please accept my apologies again. I'm going to note your record that you received a partial refund due to this disruption so we can try to provide better service next time. Thank you for flying United, despite the delay, and I hope the rest of your trips go smoothly.\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: Yeah okay, thanks I guess. *sigh* \\\\n\\\\nAgent: You're very welcome sir, and thank you for taking the time to call today. I hope the refund helps to make up for some of the trouble.

Does that work with your schedule? I know it's a couple days later than your original flight but it should still get you there at a decent time to settle in.\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: Yeah Monday morning works, I think I can manage that. At least this way I have a couple extra days to rest up and feel better before traveling. Thank you so much for your help Steven, I really appreciate you being able to change my flight for me.\\\\n\\\\nAgent: You're very welcome, I'm glad I could help get you rescheduled to feel better for your trip.

I'm calling about my upcoming flight to Chicago next Friday.\\\\n\\\\nAgent: Okay Mark, let me pull up your reservation. What's the flight number?\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: The flight is United flight 1289, departing from Newark at 6pm. \\\\n\\\\nAgent: Alright, let me see...okay I've found your reservation. What questions did you have about the flight?\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: Well, I recently had to change my travel plans and need to change the date of my return flight from Chicago. The current return date on my ticket is for the following Wednesday but I need to come back the Monday instead. Is there any way I can change that?\\\\n\\\\nAgent: Um, let me check availability for that Monday flight... *typing noises* Hmm, it looks like that flight is pretty full up. I'm just not seeing any seats available unfortunately on the Monday you need. Would you be open to another date, or flying a different airline perhaps?\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: Ugh that's not really ideal. I have meetings scheduled for Tuesday that I need to be back for. What other options might there be to still get back on Monday? Would I have to pay a change fee or get a whole new ticket?\\\\n\\\\nAgent: I understand the timing isn't ideal. *pause as agent checks options* Okay, so it looks like we could get you booked on that Monday flight, but there would be a change fee of $150 plus any difference in fare. Or, we could also try putting you on our partner airline American and see if they have availability, which may be a little cheaper to change. What works best for your situation?\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: Hmm that change fee is pretty steep. Let me ask, is there any way you could waive it or provide a credit of any kind since this is really just a one day change on the return? I'm already booking a roundtrip with United so it seems a bit excessive. \\\\n\\\\nAgent: You're right, charging a fee for such a minor change does seem a bit much. Let me check if there's anything I can do... *more typing noises* Unfortunately our change fee policies are pretty strict, but I was able to find a $75 credit I can apply to your ticket to help offset the cost a bit. How does that sound?\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: You know, that $75 credit does really help. I appreciate you taking a look to see if there was any way to help reduce the fee. Alright, let's go ahead and make the change then with the $75 credit.\\\\n\\\\nAgent: Great, I'm happy we could work that out. Just need to read back the new itinerary details to you...your new return flight will be United flight 1592, departing Chicago O'Hare on Monday at 1:30pm, arriving Newark at 3:45pm. The change fee will be $150 but with the $75 credit applied, the additional amount due is $75. Does this work for you?\\\\n\\\\nCustomer: Yes, that all looks perfect. Thank you so much for your help Steve, I really appreciate you taking the time to find a solution.\\\\n\\\\nAgent: You're very welcome, happy I could help get you on that flight. Thank you for flying United, and enjoy the rest of your travels! You'll receive an email confirmation of the itinerary change shortly.
